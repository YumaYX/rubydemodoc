This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to create a dynamic class using the `Class` method, which takes a block of code as an argument. The block is used to define the behavior and attributes of the new class. In this example, the `create_dynamic_class` method takes a hash of key-value pairs as an argument and returns a new class that has accessors for each key in the hash. The `initialize` method sets instance variables based on the values in the hash.
