This Ruby code snippet demonstrates a dynamic class creation. It defines a `create_dynamic_class` function that generates a class based on a provided hash. This class automatically creates instance variables for each key in the hash, allowing you to define and access attributes dynamically based on the hash's content, and then creates an instance of this class and sets its attributes.
