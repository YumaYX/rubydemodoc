This Ruby code snippet demonstrates a method to dynamically create a class based on a hash. The `create_dynamic_class` function takes a hash as input and generates a new class. This class includes accessors for each key in the input hash, allowing instance attributes to be defined dynamically. Specifically, the `attr_accessor` method creates getter and setter methods for each key, enabling the retrieval and modification of instance variables.  The `initialize` method then uses `instance_variable_set` to create instance variables named after the keys in the input hash, setting the corresponding values.  Once the class `kls` is created from the `data` hash, an object `obj` is instantiated from this class. Subsequently, the code accesses and prints the values of the `name`, `age`, and `city` attributes of the `obj` object, confirming that the dynamic class correctly created and populated the attributes based on the hash data.
