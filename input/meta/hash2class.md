This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the creation of a dynamic class based on a given hash. First, a hash `data` containing key-value pairs (name, age, city) is defined. The `create_dynamic_class` method takes a hash as input and dynamically creates a new class. Inside the class definition, it iterates through the keys of the input hash and adds an `attr_accessor` for each key, effectively creating instance variables with getter and setter methods. It also defines an `initialize` method that iterates through the key-value pairs of the input hash and sets the corresponding instance variables using `instance_variable_set`.  A dynamic class `kls` is created using the `create_dynamic_class` method with the `data` hash. Then, an instance `obj` of the dynamically created class `kls` is instantiated. Finally, the code accesses the instance variables `name`, `age`, and `city` of the object `obj` and prints their values, demonstrating that the dynamic class has successfully captured and exposed the data from the input hash.
