This Ruby code snippet demonstrates dynamic class creation. It takes a hash (`data`) and creates a new class whose attributes are dynamically defined based on the hash keys. The `create_dynamic_class` method defines accessors (using `attr_accessor`) and an `initialize` method to set instance variables corresponding to the hash keys and values.  An instance of the dynamically created class (`obj`) is then created and its attributes can be accessed like any other object's attributes (e.g., `obj.name`, `obj.age`).
