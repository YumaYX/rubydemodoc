This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to create a dynamic class in Ruby. The `create_dynamic_class` method takes a hash of attributes as an argument and returns a new class that has accessors for each key in the hash. The `initialize` method is also defined, which sets the instance variables of the object based on the values in the hash.

For example, when you call `create_dynamic_class(data)`, it will create a new class with attributes `name`, `age`, and `city`. You can then create an instance of this class using `obj = kls.new` and access the attributes using `obj.name`, `obj.age`, etc.

Note that this is a contrived example, but it demonstrates how to create a dynamic class in Ruby with accessors for each key in a hash.
