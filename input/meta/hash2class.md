This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the creation of a dynamic class based on a given hash. The `create_dynamic_class` function takes a hash as input and returns a new class. This class automatically generates attributes based on the keys in the input hash, allowing for flexible and adaptable class definitions.  The `each_key` method iterates over the hash keys, and `attr_accessor` creates getter and setter methods for each key, effectively adding them as instance variables to the dynamically created class.  The `initialize` method then populates these instance variables with the corresponding values from the input hash, ensuring that the dynamically created class has the appropriate attributes.

To use this dynamically generated class, the `create_dynamic_class` function is called with the `data` hash, storing the result in the `kls` variable. An instance of this class is then created using `kls.new()`, and assigned to the `obj` variable.  When accessed, `obj` returns the class itself.  Calling `obj.name` will return the value associated with the key "name" in the `data` hash, which is "Alice". Similarly, `obj.age` will return the value associated with the key "age", which is 25, and `obj.city` returns "Tokyo".
