This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the creation of a dynamic class based on a given hash. First, a hash `data` is defined containing key-value pairs representing attributes like name, age, and city. The `create_dynamic_class` method takes this hash as input and dynamically creates a new class. Inside the class definition, it iterates through the keys of the input hash and adds an `attr_accessor` for each key, effectively creating instance variables with getter and setter methods. It also defines an `initialize` method that populates the instance variables of the new class using the key-value pairs from the input hash.  A dynamic class `kls` is created using the `data` hash, and then an object `obj` is instantiated from this class. Finally, the code demonstrates accessing the attributes of the object using dot notation, retrieving the values associated with the `name`, `age`, and `city` keys from the original hash. The output will be the respective values of these attributes.
