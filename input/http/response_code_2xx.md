This Ruby code snippet demonstrates a function called `rc2xx?` that checks if an HTTP response code falls within the 2xx range (success). The function takes a URI as input, parses it to get the host, port, and path, and then creates a new `Net::HTTP` object to make an HTTP GET request to the specified URI. It handles SSL/TLS based on the scheme of the URI.  The function then retrieves the response code from the HTTP response and checks if it's greater than or equal to 200 and less than 300. If both conditions are true, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`. The code then calls the `rc2xx?` function with the URI "https://yumayx.github.io/" and prints the result.
