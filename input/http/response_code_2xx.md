This Ruby code snippet demonstrates a method called `rc2xx?` that checks whether the HTTP status code of a given URL is within the range of 200-299, which indicates success. The method takes a string parameter representing the URL and returns a boolean value indicating whether the request was successful or not.

The method first parses the input URL using the `URI` class to extract the hostname, port number, and scheme (HTTP or HTTPS). It then creates an instance of the `Net::HTTP` class and sets the `use_ssl` property to true if the scheme is "https".

The method then constructs a `Get` request object using the `Net::HTTP::Get.new` method and sends it to the server using the `request` method. The response from the server is then captured in the `response` variable.

Finally, the status code of the response is extracted using the `code` method and converted to an integer value using the `to_i` method. The method returns true if the status code is within the range of 200-299, and false otherwise.
