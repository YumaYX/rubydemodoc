This Ruby code snippet demonstrates a function `rc2xx?` that checks if a given URI returns an HTTP response code in the 2xx range (success). It uses the `net/http` library to make an HTTP GET request to the provided URI.  The function parses the URI, establishes an HTTP connection (handling HTTPS if necessary), sends the request, and returns `true` if the response code is between 200 and 299 (inclusive), otherwise it returns `false`. The example call `rc2xx?("https://yumayx.github.io/")` successfully returns `true` because the website responds with a 200 status code.
