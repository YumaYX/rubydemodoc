This Ruby code snippet demonstrates a function called `rc2xx?` that checks if an HTTP response code falls within the 2xx range (successful responses). The function takes a URI as input, parses it to extract the host and port, and establishes an HTTP connection. It handles SSL if the URL scheme is HTTPS.  It then sends a GET request to the specified path and retrieves the response. The code extracts the response code, converts it to an integer, and checks if it's greater than or equal to 200 and less than 300. Finally, it returns `true` if the response code is within the 2xx range, and `false` otherwise. The code then calls this function with the URL "https://yumayx.github.io/" and the result is printed to the console.
