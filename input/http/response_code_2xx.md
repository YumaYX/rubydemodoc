This Ruby code snippet demonstrates a method `rc2xx?` that takes a string argument representing a URL and returns true if the server responds with an HTTP status code between 200-299, and false otherwise. The method first parses the URL using the `URI.parse` method, then creates a new `Net::HTTP` instance for the host and port of the URL, sets the `use_ssl` property if necessary based on whether the URL scheme is "https", and finally makes an HTTP GET request to the parsed URL path using the `Net::HTTP::Get` class. Finally, it checks the response code returned by the server and returns true if it falls in the range of 200-299, and false otherwise.

The method is then called with a sample URL "https://yumayx.github.io/" to demonstrate its functionality.
