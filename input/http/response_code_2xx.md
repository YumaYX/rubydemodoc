This Ruby code snippet demonstrates a function `rc2xx?` that checks if an HTTP request to a given URI returns a 2xx status code (successful). It uses the `net/http` library to make a GET request and verifies the response code is between 200 and 299 (inclusive). The example then calls this function with "https://yumayx.github.io/" and confirms it returns `true`, indicating a successful response.
