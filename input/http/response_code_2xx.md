This Ruby code snippet demonstrates a function designed to check if a given URL responds with a successful HTTP status code (200-299). The `rc2xx?` function takes a URL string as input. It first parses the URL using `URI.parse` to extract the hostname and port. Then, it creates a `Net::HTTP` object, enabling SSL if the URL is HTTPS. A GET request is constructed using `Net::HTTP::Get.new` targeting the URL's path. The function sends this request and retrieves the HTTP response. It then extracts the response code, converts it to an integer, and finally, it returns `true` if the response code falls within the successful range of 200 to 299 (inclusive), otherwise it returns `false`. When the function is called with "https://yumayx.github.io/", it will likely return `true` because a GET request to that URL typically returns a 200 OK status code.
