This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to set up a logger in Ruby and then print the current log level to the standard output.

First, the code requires the `logger` module, which provides the functionality for logging messages. Then, it creates a new logger instance, configuring it to output log messages to the standard output (STDOU).  After that, it prints the current log level using the `Level` constant, which indicates the severity of the messages that will be logged.  The `Level` constant is typically set to a value like `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, or `FATAL`, determining the minimum severity of messages that will be recorded.
