This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the usage of the `Logger` class. It initializes a logger that writes to standard output, logs messages at different levels (INFO, WARN, INFO, DEBUG), and shows how to set the logging level. The code demonstrates logging messages with different levels and highlights the fact that debugging messages are not outputted.
