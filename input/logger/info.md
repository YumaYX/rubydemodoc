This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the usage of the `Logger` class in Ruby for recording log messages. The code first initializes a logger that directs output to the standard output (STDOUT). It then sets the logging level to `Logger::INFO`, which means that messages with a severity of INFO, WARN, and ERROR will be logged.  The code then proceeds to log several messages with different severities: a warning message ("Nothing to do!"), an informational message ("Program started"), and a debug message ("Created logger"). Because the logging level is set to INFO, the debug message is not output. The warning and informational messages are output to the standard output.
