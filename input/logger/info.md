This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the usage of a `Logger` object in Ruby. The first line, `require 'logger'`, is used to load the `Logger` module into the current scope.

The next line, `logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)`, creates a new `Logger` object and assigns it to the variable `logger`. The parameter `STDOUT` is passed to the constructor, which tells the logger to write its output to the standard output stream (i.e., the console).

The third line, `puts "Level INFO"`, outputs a string to the console indicating that the log level has been set to INFO. The fourth line, `logger.level = Logger::INFO`, sets the log level of the logger to INFO. This means that only messages with a severity level of INFO or higher will be output by the logger.

The fifth line, `logger.warn("Nothing to do!")`, outputs a warning message to the console using the `warn` method. The method takes a string parameter containing the message to be output. Since the log level is set to INFO, this message will not be output because its severity level is lower than INFO.

The sixth line, `logger.info("Program started")`, outputs an informational message to the console using the `info` method. This message has a severity level of INFO, which means it will be output by the logger because the log level is set to INFO or higher.

Finally, the seventh line, `logger.debug("Created logger")`, outputs a debug message to the console using the `debug` method. Since the log level is set to INFO, this message will not be output because its severity level is lower than INFO.
