This Ruby code snippet demonstrates basic logging functionality using the `Logger` class. It initializes a logger to output to the standard output (STDOUT), sets the logging level to INFO, and then demonstrates logging messages at different levels: WARN, INFO, and DEBUG. The output shows that the logger successfully records these messages with timestamps and levels.
