This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `Logger` class from the standard library in Ruby to log messages with different levels (error, warn, info, debug). The `require 'logger'` statement loads the Logger module into the current context.
The next line creates a new instance of the `Logger` class and sets it to write to the `STDOUT`.
The `puts "Level INFO"` line outputs the level that will be used for logging.
The `logger.level = Logger::INFO` line changes the level from which logs are written to the logger object. In this case, only messages with a level of `Logger::INFO` or higher (warn and error) will be output.
The next two lines demonstrate the use of different methods for logging messages: `logger.warn("Nothing to do!")` outputs a warning message, while `logger.info("Program started")` outputs an informational message. The last line, `logger.debug("Created logger")`, does not output anything because its level is lower than the current level set in the previous line (INFO).
By setting different levels for logging messages, you can control the verbosity of your application's logs and focus on the most important information.
