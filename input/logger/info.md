This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `Logger` class for logging messages at different severity levels. It initializes a logger that outputs to `STDOUT`, sets the logging level to `INFO`, and then logs messages at `WARN`, `INFO`, and `DEBUG` levels. Only `WARN` and `INFO` messages are displayed because the logger's level is set to `INFO`, filtering out `DEBUG` messages. The output shows the severity level, timestamp, and the message itself.
