This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `Logger` class to handle logging output within a Ruby application. The code initializes a `Logger` object, setting its output destination to standard output (`STDOUT`). Then, it prints "Level INFO" to the console. The `logger.level = Logger::INFO` line adjusts the loggerâ€™s level to `INFO`, causing any messages at lower levels (like DEBUG) to be suppressed. Subsequently, the code executes `logger.warn("Nothing to do!")`, which outputs a warning message to standard output.  Furthermore, `logger.info("Program started")` produces an info-level message, and `logger.debug("Created logger")` does not generate any output because the logger's level is set to `INFO`.
