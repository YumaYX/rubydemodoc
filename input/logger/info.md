This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the creation and use of a `Logger` object in Ruby. The code initializes a `Logger` instance using `Logger.new(STDOUT)`, which directs log output to the standard output stream. It then sets the log level to `Logger::INFO` to capture informational messages. The code includes calls to `logger.warn`, `logger.info`, and `logger.debug`, which would have been logged if the log level was set to `Logger::INFO` or higher. However, because the log level is set to `Logger::INFO`, only `logger.info` and `logger.warn` would have been output to the console.
