This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to set the logging level of a logger object in Ruby. The `Logger` class provides several levels of logging, including `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, and `ERROR`. By default, the logging level is set to `INFO`.

In this code snippet, we first create a new instance of the `Logger` class and assign it to a variable named `logger`. We then set the logging level of the logger object to `WARN` using the `level=` method. This means that only messages with a severity level of WARN or higher will be logged.

Next, we output three log messages using the `warn`, `info`, and `debug` methods of the `Logger` class. The first message is logged at the `WARN` level, so it should be displayed because the logging level is set to `WARN`. The second message is logged at the `INFO` level, but since the logging level is only set to `WARN`, it will not be displayed. The third message is logged at the `DEBUG` level, but since the logging level is only set to `WARN`, it will also not be displayed.

Overall, this code snippet demonstrates how to set the logging level of a logger object in Ruby and how to use different methods to log messages with different severity levels.
