This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to create a logger and configure its logging level. The code initializes a Logger object and sets the logging level to WARN using `logger.level = Logger::WARN`.  It then demonstrates logging messages at different levels (WARN, INFO, DEBUG) and shows that only messages at the WARN level or higher will be output. The `STDOUT` is used as the output destination for the logger.
