This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the basic setup of a logger in a Ruby program. It first requires the 'logger' module, which provides the functionality for logging messages. Then, it creates a new logger instance and configures it to output messages to the standard output (STDOut). Finally, it attempts to print the value of the 'Level' variable, but since 'Level' is not defined, it will likely output `nil` or raise a NameError. The logger object is created but not used to log any messages in this particular snippet.
