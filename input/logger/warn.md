This Ruby code snippet demonstrates basic usage of the `Logger` class. It initializes a logger that outputs to standard output (STDOUT) and then sets the logging level to `WARN`.  Messages with severity levels of `WARN` and higher (e.g., `ERROR`, `FATAL`) will be printed, while `INFO` and `DEBUG` messages are suppressed because the logging level is set to `WARN`. The output shows only the `WARN` message being printed to the console, along with a timestamp and severity level.
