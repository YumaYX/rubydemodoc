This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to use the `Logger` class in Ruby to log messages with different levels of severity. The `Logger` class is used to create a new logger object, which can then be used to log messages at different levels. In this example, we create a logger that logs messages to the standard output (STDOUT) and set its level to `WARN`. We then log three messages with different severity levels: one at the warn level, another at the info level, and a third at the debug level. The `Logger` class only outputs messages at or above the current logging level, so we only see the message "Nothing to do!" in our output.

Note that the `Logger` class is part of Ruby's standard library, and it provides a simple way to log messages with different levels of severity. The `WARN`, `INFO`, and `DEBUG` constants are used to specify the level of each message. You can use these constants or any other integer value to set the logging level.
