This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `Logger` class to record messages with different severity levels. 

The code first requires the `logger` library. It then creates a new logger instance, configured to output to standard output (STDOut). The code sets the logging level to `Logger::WARN`, meaning that only warnings and more severe messages will be logged. 

Next, it demonstrates logging messages with different severity levels: a warning message ("Nothing to do!"), an informational message ("Program started"), a debug message ("Created logger"). Because the logging level is set to WARN, the informational and debug messages will not be displayed. The warning message will be displayed on the standard output because it is above the WARN level.
