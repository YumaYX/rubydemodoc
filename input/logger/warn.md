This Ruby code snippet demonstrates basic logging functionality using the `Logger` class. It initializes a logger to output to the standard output (STDOUT), sets the logging level to `WARN`, and then demonstrates logging messages at different levels: `WARN`, `INFO`, and `DEBUG`. The `warn` method outputs a warning message, while `info` and `debug` messages are not displayed because the logging level is set to `WARN`, which only displays messages of that level or higher.
