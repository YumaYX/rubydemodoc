This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to use the `Logger` class in Ruby to log messages at different levels of severity. The code first creates a new `Logger` instance that outputs logs to `STDOUT`. It then sets the logging level to `WARN`, which means that only warnings and errors will be outputted. The code also demonstrates how to use the `warn`, `info`, and `debug` methods to log messages at different levels of severity.

The `warn` method is used to log a warning message, while the `info` method is used to log an informational message. The `debug` method is used to log a debug message.

Note that the logging level can be changed dynamically by assigning a new value to the `level` attribute of the `Logger` instance. This allows for fine-grained control over the type of messages that are outputted.
