This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `Logger` class to manage and control logging output within a Ruby program. It initializes a logger object, `logger`, which is configured to write to standard output (`STDOUT`). The code then prints "Level WARN" to the console, but crucially, it sets the logger's level to `Logger::WARN`. Subsequently, the `warn` method is called on the logger, causing it to output "Nothing to do!" to standard output, because the level is set to WARN.  The `info` and `debug` methods are called, however, because the loggerâ€™s level is set to WARN, these messages are suppressed and do not appear in the output.
