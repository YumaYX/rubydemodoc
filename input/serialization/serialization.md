This code serializes a Ruby object (a hash named `person`) into a binary string and then writes that string to a file named `person.dat`.

Specifically, `Marshal.dump(person)` converts the Ruby object `person` into a binary representation of its data.  `File.open` opens a file for writing in binary mode ('wb'), and `file.write(serialized_person)` writes the binary string to that file. This is a common way to persist serialized data like Ruby objects to disk.
