This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the process of serializing a Ruby hash object (representing a person's data) into a string format and then writing that string to a file.  Initially, a hash named `person` is created, containing key-value pairs for 'name' and 'age'. The `Marshal.dump` method is used to convert this hash into a serialized string representation, assigned to the variable `serialized_person`. Subsequently, the code opens a file named 'input/serialization/person.dat' in binary write mode ('wb').  The `file.write` method then writes the contents of `serialized_person` to this file, effectively saving the serialized representation of the `person` hash to a data file.
