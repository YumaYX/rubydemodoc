This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to serialize a Ruby object (a hash representing a person) into a byte stream using `Marshal.dump` and then write that byte stream to a file. The `Marshal.dump` method converts the `person` hash into a serialized byte representation, which is then written to the file 'input/serialization/person.dat'. This allows for later reconstruction of the original object.
