This Ruby code snippet demonstrates object serialization using `Marshal.dump` to convert a Ruby hash (`person`) into a byte string. This byte string is then written to a binary file named `person.dat` in the `input/serialization` directory. This process persists the Ruby object's data to a file for later retrieval and deserialization.
