This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to serialize a Ruby object into a byte stream and write it to a file using the `Marshal` module. First, a hash named `person` is defined with key-value pairs for "name" and "age". Then, the `Marshal.dump` method is used to serialize the `person` hash into a byte stream, which is stored in the `serialized_person` variable. Finally, the code opens a file named "person.dat" in write-binary mode (`'wb'`) and writes the `serialized_person` byte stream to the file. This allows for the persistence of the `person` object's state, which can later be loaded back using `Marshal.load`.
