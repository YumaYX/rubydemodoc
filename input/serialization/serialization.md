This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to use the `Marshal` module to serialize a Ruby object and write it to a file. The `Marshal.dump` method is used to convert the `person` object into a binary string, which can then be written to a file using the `File.open` method. The file name 'input/serialization/person.dat' specifies that the output file should be located in a subdirectory called 'input' and 'serialization'. The resulting serialized data will be stored in the specified file.
