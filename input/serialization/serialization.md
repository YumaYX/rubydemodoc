This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to serialize a Ruby hash (representing a person's data) into a string and then write that string to a binary file. The code first defines a hash named `person` with keys "name" and "age", assigning the values "Alice" and 30, respectively. Next, the `Marshal.dump` method is used to serialize the `person` hash into a string, which is then assigned to the variable `serialized_person`. Finally, the code opens a file named "input/serialization/person.dat" in binary write mode ('wb'). The `Marshal.dump` output is then written to this file, effectively saving the serialized representation of the person's data in a persistent manner.
