This Ruby code snippet demonstrates object serialization using the `Marshal` module. It creates a hash named `person` containing a name and age, then serializes this hash into a string representation using `Marshal.dump()`. Finally, it writes this serialized string to a file named `input/serialization/person.dat` in binary write mode (`wb`).
