This Ruby code snippet demonstrates deserialization of a serialized Ruby object. It reads a serialized string from the 'person.dat' file, which represents a Ruby hash containing a person's name and age. The `Marshal.load` function then parses this serialized string back into a Ruby hash, resulting in the hash `{name: "Alice", age: 30}`.
