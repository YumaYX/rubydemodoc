This code uses `Marshal` to deserialize a serialized object (likely a Python object) from a data file.  `Marshal` is a Python library that converts Python objects into a byte stream (serialization) and then converts that byte stream back into a Python object (deserialization).  `File.read()` reads the entire contents of the file named `input/serialization/person.dat` as a string. `Marshal.load()` then takes that string and reconstructs the Python object that was originally serialized.
