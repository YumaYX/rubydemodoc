This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading a serialized person object from a file named "person.dat", which is likely stored using the `Marshal` library. It then deserializes the data back into a Ruby hash. The `File.read` method reads the content of the file as a string, and `Marshal.load` converts this string representation back into a Ruby object (in this case, a hash with `name` and `age` keys). The serialized data appears to be encoded using a custom format, possibly involving control characters.
