This Ruby code snippet demonstrates a process of reading a serialized object from a file and then deserializing it back into a Ruby object. Specifically, the line `serialized_person = File.read('input/serialization/person.dat')` uses the `File.read` method to read the entire content of a file named "person.dat" located within a directory called "input/serialization" and stores the content as a string in the variable `serialized_person`. Subsequently, `Marshal.load(serialized_person)` utilizes the `Marshal.load` method to parse the string stored in `serialized_person`, which is assumed to be a serialized representation of a Ruby object (likely a hash or an object defined using `Marshal.dump`), and converts it back into the original Ruby object, effectively restoring the object's state from the file.
