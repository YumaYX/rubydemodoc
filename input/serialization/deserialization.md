This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading data from a file, deserializing it using the Marshal module, and then loading the deserialized data. Specifically, the code reads the entire content of the file named 'input/serialization/person.dat' into a string variable called `serialized_person`.  It then uses the `Marshal.load()` method to reconstruct an object from the serialized data stored in the `serialized_person` string. The loaded object is then implicitly assigned to a variable, although the variable name is not explicitly stated in the provided snippet.  The `Marshal` module is used for serializing and deserializing Ruby objects into a byte stream format, which can be useful for storing and retrieving object state.
