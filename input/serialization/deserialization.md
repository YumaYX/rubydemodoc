This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to deserialize a serialized object using the `Marshal` module. Specifically, it reads a string from the file 'input/serialization/person.dat' and then uses `Marshal.load()` to convert this string back into a Ruby object, likely a `Person` object based on the filename convention. The `Marshal` module is used for serializing and deserializing Ruby objects, allowing you to save the state of an object to a file and later restore it.
