This Ruby code snippet demonstrates deserialization of data stored in a binary format using `Marshal`. It first reads the binary data from the file 'person.dat' and then uses `Marshal.load` to convert the binary string back into a Ruby hash object containing the name "Alice" and age 30. `Marshal` is used to serialize Ruby objects into a byte stream, and `Marshal.load` reconstructs the object from that stream.
