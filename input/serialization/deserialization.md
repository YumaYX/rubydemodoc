This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a file serialized using the Marshal library and then deserialize that data back into a Ruby object. Specifically, the code first uses `File.read('input/serialization/person.dat')` to read the entire contents of the file named 'input/serialization/person.dat' into the variable `serialized_person` as a string. Then, the `Marshal.load(serialized_person)` function is called, which parses the string content of `serialized_person`, which was previously serialized by Marshal, and reconstructs the original Ruby object (likely a Hash or a custom class) that was saved to the file. The reconstructed object is then assigned back to a variable (although the specific variable name is not explicitly shown in this code snippet).
