This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading data from a file, deserializing it using the Marshal module, and then using the deserialized data. 

The code first reads the entire content of the file named 'input/serialization/person.dat' into a string variable called `serialized_person`.  Then, it uses the `Marshal.load()` method to deserialize the data stored in the `serialized_person` string.  `Marshal.load()` takes a string containing a serialized Ruby object and converts it back into the original object.  The resulting deserialized object is then assigned to the variable `serialized_person`.  The code assumes that the file 'input/serialization/person.dat' contains a serialized Ruby object that can be reconstructed using Marshal.  The type of the object is not specified, but it is likely a complex data structure such as a hash or a class instance.
