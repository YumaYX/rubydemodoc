This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to deserialize a serialized object using the `Marshal` class in Ruby. The `File.read` method is used to read the contents of a file, which contains the serialized data for an object. The `Marshal.load` method is then used to load the serialized data and create a new object from it.

Note that this code assumes that the serialized data is stored in a file named "person.dat" in the "input/serialization" directory.
