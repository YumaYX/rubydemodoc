This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to deserialize a serialized object in Ruby using the `Marshal` class. The first line reads the serialized object from a file and stores it in the `serialized_person` variable. The second line uses the `Marshal.load` method to deserialize the object, which returns the original object that was serialized. Note that the `serialized_person` variable must contain the data of the serialized object, which is stored in a file called 'input/serialization/person.dat' in this example.
