This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to calculate the date of the previous Monday. 

First, it gets the current date and time using `Time.now` and stores it in the variable `today`. 
Then, it calculates the time difference between today and the previous Monday. It subtracts the number of days from today to the previous Monday, which is calculated as `today.wday - 1`, multiplied by the number of seconds in a day (24 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds). 
Finally, it stores the calculated time difference in the variable `this_monday`. 

In essence, the code determines the date of the Monday that occurred before the current day.
