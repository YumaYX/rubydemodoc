This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `$PID`, `$CHILD_STATUS`, and `$ARGV` variables. The `$PID` variable represents the process ID of the current Ruby process, and it's used to format a string. The `$CHILD_STATUS` variable, although not directly used in the provided examples, is related to the status of child processes and is associated with the `$CHILD_STATUS` variable. Finally, the `$ARGV` variable is an array containing command-line arguments passed to the Ruby script, such as "31" and "/home/hoge/fuga.txt".
