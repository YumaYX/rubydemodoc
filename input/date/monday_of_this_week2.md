This Ruby code snippet demonstrates calculating the date of the previous Monday. The code initializes a variable named `today` to represent the current date and time using the `Time.now` method.  Then, it calculates the date of the previous Monday by subtracting the number of seconds from the current date until it reaches the Monday of the week. Specifically, `today.wday` returns the day of the week as a number (0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, etc.).  The code then subtracts the difference (the number of seconds between the current day and Monday) from the current date using the `today - (today.wday - 1) * 24 * 60 * 60`. The result is stored in the `this_monday` variable, which holds the date and time representing the previous Monday.
