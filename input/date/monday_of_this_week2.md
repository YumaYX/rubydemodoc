This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to get the date of this Monday using the `Time` class and its methods. The `Time.now` method returns the current time as a `Time` object, and the `wday` method returns the day of the week as an integer (0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, etc.). By subtracting the number of days from this Sunday to get to this Monday, we can calculate the date of this Monday. The code then stores this date in a variable called `this_monday`.
