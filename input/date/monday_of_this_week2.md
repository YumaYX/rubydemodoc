This code calculates the date of the previous Monday.

*   `today = Time.now`: Gets the current date and time.
*   `this_monday = today - (today.wday - 1) * 24 * 60 * 60`: Subtracts the difference in seconds from the current date to the previous Monday.  `today.wday` returns the day of the week (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, ..., 6 = Saturday).  The code then calculates the number of seconds to subtract to reach the previous Monday.
