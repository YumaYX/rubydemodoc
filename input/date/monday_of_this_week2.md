This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to calculate the date of the previous Monday. First, it gets the current date and time using `Time.now` and stores it in the variable `today`. Then, it calculates the time difference between today and the previous Monday.  `today.wday` returns the day of the week as an integer (Sunday=0, Monday=1, etc.).  We subtract `(today.wday - 1) * 24 * 60 * 60` from `today` to get the time corresponding to the previous Monday. This is done by first subtracting one from the day of the week to get the previous day, then converting that to seconds, minutes, and hours, and finally subtracting that time from the current time. The result is stored in the variable `this_monday`.
