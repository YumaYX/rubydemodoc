This Ruby code snippet demonstrates calculating the date of this Monday. It first gets the current time using `Time.now`. Then, it calculates the number of seconds to subtract from the current time to reach the previous Monday, using `today.wday` to determine the day of the week and performing the necessary subtraction in seconds. The result, `this_monday`, holds the timestamp for this Monday.
