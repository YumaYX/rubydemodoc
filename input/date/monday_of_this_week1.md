 This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to create a variable for the current day and another variable for the next Monday from the current date using the `Date` class in Ruby. The `today` variable is set to the current date using the `Date.today` method, and the `this_monday` variable is set to the previous Monday by subtracting the number of days until the next Monday (which is equal to 1) from the current day.

For example, if today is a Thursday, then `today` would be set to "Thursday, February 25, 2022" and `this_monday` would be set to "Monday, February 28, 2022".
