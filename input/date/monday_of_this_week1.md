This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to get the date of this Monday using the `Date` class in Ruby. It first gets the current date using the `Date.today` method and then calculates the number of days from the current day to the next Monday using the `wday` method, which returns the day of the week (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc.). The resulting value is then added to the current date to get the date of this Monday.
