This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to calculate the date of the previous Monday. First, it requires the `date` library. Then, it gets today's date using `Date.today`. Next, it calculates the day of the week for today using `today.wday`.  The formula `today - today.wday + 1` determines the number of days to subtract from today to reach the previous Monday. Finally, it subtracts that number of days from today to get the date of the previous Monday, which is stored in the `this_monday` variable.
