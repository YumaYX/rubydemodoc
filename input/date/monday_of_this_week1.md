This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to calculate the date of the previous Monday. The code first imports the `Date` class from the `date` library, which allows us to work with dates in Ruby. It then obtains the current date using `Date.today`. Subsequently, it determines the date of the previous Monday by subtracting the current day of the week (obtained through `today.wday`) from the current date, adding 1 to the result, effectively calculating the Monday that occurred before the current date. The `this_monday` variable will hold the date of the previous Monday.
