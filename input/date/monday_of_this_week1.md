This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to calculate the date of the previous Monday. It first gets today's date, then calculates the date of the previous Monday by subtracting the current day of the week from today's date and adding 1.  The `wday` method returns the day of the week (0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, etc.).
