This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `Date` class to obtain the current date and subsequently calculate the date of the previous Monday. The `Date.today` method is used to get the current date, and then `today.wday` returns the day of the week as a number (0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, etc.). Subtracting `today.wday` from `today` calculates the number of days to subtract to reach the previous Monday. Finally, this calculated number is subtracted from `today` to obtain the date of the previous Monday, which is then assigned to the `this_monday` variable.
