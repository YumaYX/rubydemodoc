This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to calculate the date of the previous Monday. The `require 'date'` statement loads the `date` library, which provides classes for working with dates and times.  The `Date.today` method retrieves the current date.  Then, `today.wday` returns the day of the week as an integer (0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, and so on).  Finally, the code subtracts the result of `today.wday` from the current date (`today`) by adding 1 (`today - today.wday + 1`), effectively finding the date of the previous Monday.
