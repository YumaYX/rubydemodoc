This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to calculate the date of the previous Monday. First, it requires the 'date' library. Then, it gets the current date using `Date.today`. Next, it calculates the day of the week for today using `today.wday`. The formula `today - today.wday + 1` determines the number of days to subtract from today to reach the previous Monday. Finally, it calculates the date of the previous Monday and assigns it to the variable `this_monday`.
