This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to get the current time and format it into a specific string representation. The code first captures the current time using `Time.now` and stores it in the variable `t`. Then, it uses the `stftime(%F)` method on the `t` object. The `%F` format specifier instructs `stftime` to represent the date and time in the ISO 8601 format, which is `YYYY-MM-DD`. Therefore, the code retrieves the current date and time and formats it as a string in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
