This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to obtain the date in a specific format from a `Time` object. The `Time.now` function returns the current date and time as a `Time` object. Subsequently, `t.strftime("%F")` uses the `strftime` method to format this `Time` object into a string. The format string `"%F"` instructs the `strftime` method to format the date as "YYYY-MM-DD", which is the ISO 8601 date format.  Therefore, the code effectively converts the current date and time into a string representing the date in the YYYY-MM-DD format.
