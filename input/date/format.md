 This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to get the current date in the ISO 8601 format using the `Time` class and the `strftime` method. The `strftime` method takes a string argument that specifies the format of the output, and `%F` is a special code that represents the full date in the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

The code first creates a new instance of the `Time` class using the `now` method. This method returns the current time as a `Time` object.

Then, it uses the `strftime` method to get the current date in the ISO 8601 format. The `%F` code is used to specify that the output should be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.

Here is an example of how this code might be used:
```
t = Time.now
puts t.strftime("%F") # Output: 2023-01-15
```
In this example, the current date (January 15, 2023) is printed to the console in the ISO 8601 format.
