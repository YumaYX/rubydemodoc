This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `Date` module and its `MONTHNAMES` constant. The `MONTHNAMES` constant is an array containing the names of the months of the year. When this line of code is executed, it will output the array of month names to the console.

The `require 'date'` statement loads the `date` library, which provides classes and constants for working with dates. The `Date::MONTHNAMES` accesses the `MONTHNAMES` constant within the `Date` module. This constant is an array of strings, where each string represents the name of a month. For example, the first element of the array will be "January", the second will be "February", and so on.
