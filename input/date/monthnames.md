This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `date` library in Ruby to access the names of the months. Specifically, it imports the `date` library and then accesses the `MONTHNAMES` constant within that library. The `MONTHNAMES` constant is an array containing the names of the months of the year.

The `MONTHNAMES` constant is defined within the `Date` class and provides a convenient way to retrieve the month names. This can be useful for various tasks such as formatting dates or displaying calendar information. The code simply accesses this constant, which will result in an array containing the names of the months in the default locale.
