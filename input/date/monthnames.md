This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `date` library to access a predefined list of month names.  The `require 'date'` statement loads the `date` library, which provides functionality for working with dates and times in Ruby. The `Date::MONTHNAMES` constant then accesses a collection of strings, each representing the name of a month (January, February, March, and so on), providing a convenient way to iterate through the month names within a Ruby program.
