This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to use the `Date` class to retrieve an array of all the month names in a specific language. The `MONTHNAMES` method returns an array of strings, where each string represents a short name for a month (e.g., "Jan", "Feb", etc.).

Here's an example usage:
```ruby
require 'date'

# Get an array of all the month names in English
english_month_names = Date::MONTHNAMES

# Print each month name to the console
english_month_names.each do |name|
  puts name
end
```
In this example, the `Date` class is required using the `require` keyword, and then the `MONTHNAMES` method is called on the `Date` class to get an array of all the month names in English. The resulting array is then iterated over using the `each` method to print each month name to the console.

Note that this code snippet uses the `puts` method to print each month name to the console, which will display the output as a series of lines. If you prefer to have the output displayed in a single line, you can use the `print` or `p` methods instead. For example:
```ruby
require 'date'

# Get an array of all the month names in English
english_month_names = Date::MONTHNAMES

# Print each month name to the console using print()
english_month_names.each do |name|
  print name + " "
end
```
This will display the output as a single line, with each month name separated by a space.
