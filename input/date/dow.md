This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to define an array of fixed-size elements, where each element is a frozen string. The `%w` syntax is used to create an array of strings from a list of words separated by spaces or newlines. The `map(&:freeze)` method is used to freeze each string in the array, and the final `.freeze` method is used to make the entire array immutable (i.e., unchangeable). This can be useful when you want to create a set of constants that cannot be modified after they are defined.
