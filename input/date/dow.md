This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the creation of a constant named `DOW_JP` which stores the Japanese names of the days of the week. The code uses a regular expression to define an array of these names and then employs the `map` method to freeze the array, ensuring that the elements are immutable.  The `freeze` method is applied twice to ensure the array is immutable and prevents accidental modification. The resulting constant `DOW_JP` is an immutable array containing the Japanese day names.
