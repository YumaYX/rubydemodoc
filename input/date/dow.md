 This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to create a frozen array of strings in Ruby. The code creates an array called `DOW_JP` and initializes it with the seven days of the week in Japanese, using the `%w[]` syntax. It then uses the `map()` method to freeze each element of the array, and finally freezes the entire array itself.

Note: Frozen objects are objects that cannot be modified after they have been created. In this case, the array `DOW_JP` is frozen so that it can't be changed or reassigned.
