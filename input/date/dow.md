This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the creation of a frozen array named `DOW_JP` which contains the names of the days of the week in Japanese. Specifically, it initializes an array using the `%w[]` syntax, which is a shorthand for creating an array from a list of strings.  Each string within the array represents a day of the week (日, 月, 火, 水, 木, 金, 土). The `.map(&:freeze)` part iterates through each element of the array and applies the `freeze` method to it. This freezes each individual string element, preventing it from being modified after the array is created. Finally, `.freeze` is called on the entire array, freezing the array itself and preventing any modifications to its contents or structure. This ensures the array remains immutable, promoting data integrity and preventing unintended changes.
