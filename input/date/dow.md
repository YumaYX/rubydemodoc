This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the creation of a constant named `DOW_JP` which holds an array of the days of the week in Japanese. The code first defines an array containing the Japanese day names "日", "月", "火", "水", "木", "金", and "土". Then, it uses the `map` method with the block `&:freeze` to freeze each element of the array, preventing modification. Finally, it freezes the resulting array to create a completely immutable array. This ensures that the `DOW_JP` constant holds a fixed and unchanging array of the Japanese day names.
