This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the creation of an array named `DOW_JP` which represents the days of the week. It initializes an array with the strings for each day of the week: "日", "月", "火", "水", "木", "金", and "土". The `.map(&:freeze)` method is used to convert each string into an immutable string object, and the `.freeze` method is used to make each string immutable. The result is a frozen array containing immutable string objects representing the days of the week.
