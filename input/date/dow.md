This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the creation of a frozen array containing the Japanese abbreviations for the days of the week.  `%w[...]` creates an array of strings. `.map(&:freeze)` iterates through the array and freezes each string element (making it immutable). Finally, `.freeze` freezes the entire array itself, preventing modification. This improves performance and prevents accidental changes to the day names.
