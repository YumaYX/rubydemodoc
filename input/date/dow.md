This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to create a constant array of days of the week in Japanese. The `map` method is used to transform each element of the array into a frozen string, and then the resulting array is frozen using the `freeze` method. This ensures that the array elements cannot be modified or deleted.

Note: In Ruby, arrays are mutable by default, which means they can be modified after they are created. Freezing an array prevents any further modifications to the array's contents. The `map` method is used to modify each element of the array in-place, and then freeze the resulting array using the `freeze` method.
