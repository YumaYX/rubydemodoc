This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the creation of a constant array named `DOW_JP` which represents the days of the week in Japanese. Specifically, it initializes an array containing the Japanese names for each day of the week: “日” (Ni – Sunday), “月” (Getsu – Monday), “火” (Ka – Tuesday), “水” (Sui – Wednesday), “木” (Moku – Thursday), “金” (Kin – Friday), and “土” (Do – Saturday). The `.map(&:freeze)` part iterates through each element of the array and applies the `freeze` method, effectively making each element immutable once it's created, and finally `.freeze` freezes the entire array, preventing further modifications after initialization.
