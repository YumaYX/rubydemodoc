This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `date` library to access and manipulate dates, specifically utilizing the `Date::DAYNAMES` array, which contains the names of the days of the week. The `require 'date'` statement loads the necessary library for working with dates in Ruby, and `Date::DAYNAMES` provides an array containing strings representing each day of the week (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday). This allows developers to easily retrieve the name of a specific day of the week from within their Ruby programs.
