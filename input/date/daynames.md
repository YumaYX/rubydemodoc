 This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to access the names of days in a week using the `Date` module in Ruby. The `DAYNAMES` constant is an array of strings that contain the names of the days in order, starting with Sunday and ending with Saturday. To access these names, you can use the following syntax:
```
require 'date'
p Date::DAYNAMES # => ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"]
```
In this example, the `require` statement is used to load the `Date` module. The `p` method is then used to print out the contents of the `DAYNAMES` constant. The output will be an array containing the names of the days in order.
