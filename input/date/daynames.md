This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `Date` module within the Ruby standard library. Specifically, it includes the `require 'date'` statement to load the `Date` module, which provides functionality for working with dates and times.  The `Date::DAYNAMES` statement then accesses an array containing the names of the days of the week, which is a core component of the `Date` module.  Essentially, this code provides access to the built-in date manipulation capabilities in Ruby.
