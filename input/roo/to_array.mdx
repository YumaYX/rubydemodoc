This Ruby script utilizes the `roo` library to read data from an Excel file and store it in a two-dimensional array. Here's what it does:

1. **Require 'roo':**
   - This line imports the `roo` library into your Ruby script, enabling you to work with Excel files.

2. **Initialize an Empty Array:**
   - `two_dimensional = []`: This line initializes an empty array called `two_dimensional`, which will store the data read from the Excel sheet.

3. **Open Excel File and Select Sheet:**
   - `xlsx = Roo::Excelx.new('./book.xlsx')`: This line creates a new instance of `Roo::Excelx`, specifying the Excel file `book.xlsx` to work with.
   - `sh1 = xlsx.sheet('mysheet')`: This line selects a specific sheet named `'mysheet'` from the Excel file and assigns it to the variable `sh1`.

4. **Iterate Through Each Row:**
   - `sh1.each do |row|`: This loop iterates through each row in the selected sheet (`'mysheet'`).
   - `two_dimensional << row`: Within the loop, each row is appended to the `two_dimensional` array, effectively creating a two-dimensional array where each element represents a row in the Excel sheet.

5. **Return the Two-Dimensional Array:**
   - `two_dimensional`: Finally, the script returns the two-dimensional array containing the data read from the Excel sheet.

This script provides a straightforward way to read data from an Excel file into a two-dimensional array in Ruby, making it accessible for further processing or manipulation within your script.
