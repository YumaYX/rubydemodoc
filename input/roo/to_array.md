This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read data from an Excel spreadsheet using the `roo` gem. Specifically, it reads all rows from a sheet named "mysheet" within the "book.xlsx" file located in the "input/roo" directory and stores them as a two-dimensional array. The code uses the `Roo::Excelx` class to access the Excel file, then iterates through each row of the sheet using `each do |row|`, adding each row as a single element to the `two_dimensional` array. Finally, the code prints the contents of the `two_dimensional` array, which now contains all the rows from the spreadsheet.
