 This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read an Excel spreadsheet using the Roo gem and store the data in a two-dimensional array. The code first requires the Roo gem by adding 'require "roo"' at the top of the file. It then creates a new Roo::Excelx object called xlsx that is initialized with the path to an Excel spreadsheet ('input/roo/book.xlsx').

The next line of code retrieves a sheet from the Excel spreadsheet called 'mysheet' using the xlsx.sheet() method. The data in this sheet is then iterated over using the each do \|row\| block, and each row is added to the two_dimensional array. Finally, the entire contents of the two-dimensional array are returned at the end of the snippet.

Note that this code assumes that the Excel spreadsheet has a sheet called 'mysheet' and that it contains data in the form of rows and columns.
