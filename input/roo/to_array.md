This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read data from an Excel spreadsheet using the `roo` library and store it in a two-dimensional array. Specifically, the code first loads an Excel file named "book.xlsx" located in the "input/roo" directory. It then accesses the sheet named "mysheet" within the Excel file.  The code iterates through each row of this sheet and adds each row as an element to the `two_dimensional` array. Finally, the code prints the contents of the `two_dimensional` array, which now holds all the data from the specified sheet in a two-dimensional format.
