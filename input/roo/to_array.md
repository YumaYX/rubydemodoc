This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read data from an Excel file using the `roo` gem and store it in a two-dimensional array. The code first requires the `roo` library, which provides functionality for reading and writing Excel files. It then creates a new `Roo::Excxlsx` object, specifying the path to the Excel file ('input/roo/book.xlsx'). Next, it accesses a specific sheet within the Excel file named 'mysheet'. The code iterates through each row in the specified sheet, and for each row, it adds the row as an element to the `two_dimensional` array. Finally, the code prints the `two_dimensional` array, which now contains all the data from the Excel sheet stored in a 2D array format. This allows for easy manipulation and processing of the Excel data within the Ruby program.
