This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading data from an Excel file ('book.xlsx') using the `roo` gem. It reads the 'mysheet' sheet, iterates through each row, and populates a 2D array named `two_dimensional` with the row data.  The final `two_dimensional` array contains the data from the Excel sheet.
