This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read data from an Excel file using the `roo` gem. Specifically, it opens an Excel file named "input/roo/book.xlsx", accesses a sheet named "mysheet", and then iterates through each row of that sheet, appending each row to a two-dimensional array called `two_dimensional`. The resulting `two_dimensional` array will contain the data from the specified sheet of the Excel file.
