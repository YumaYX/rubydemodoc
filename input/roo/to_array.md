This code reads data from an Excel file (`book.xlsx`) and stores it in a 2D array called `two_dimensional`.

*   **`require 'roo'`**:  Loads the Roo library, which is needed for working with Excel files.
*   **`two_dimensional = []`**: Initializes an empty array called `two_dimensional`. This array will hold the data from the Excel sheet.
*   **`Roo::Excelx.new('input/roo/book.xlsx')`**: Creates a new Excelx object using the Roo library, opening the specified Excel file.
*   **`sh1 = xlsx.sheet('mysheet')`**:  Selects the sheet named 'mysheet' from the Excel file and assigns it to the variable `sh1`.
*   **`sh1.each do |row| ... end`**:  Iterates through each row in the selected sheet.
*   **`two_dimensional << row`**: Inside the loop, each `row` (which is itself an array representing a row in the Excel sheet) is appended to the `two_dimensional` array.
*   **`two_dimensional`**: This line prints the contents of the `two_dimensional` array to the console.
