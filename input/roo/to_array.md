This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading data from an Excel file named 'book.xlsx', specifically from the sheet 'mysheet'. It uses the `roo` gem to accomplish this. The code iterates through each row in the specified sheet and stores each row as a two-dimensional array of arrays in the `two_dimensional` variable. Finally, it prints the `two_dimensional` array, which contains the data from the Excel sheet. The data is represented as a series of arrays, where each inner array corresponds to a row in the Excel sheet, and each element within the inner array represents a cell value.
