This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read data from an Excel file using the `roo` gem and store it in a two-dimensional array. First, it requires the `roo` library, which provides functionality for reading and writing Excel files. Then, it creates a new `Roo::Excels` object, specifying the path to the Excel file ('input/roo/book.xlsx'). Next, it accesses a specific sheet within the Excel file, named 'mysheet'. The code then iterates through each row in the sheet and appends the row to the `two_dimensional` array. Finally, it prints the `two_dimensional` array, which now contains the data from the Excel sheet represented as a 2D array of arrays.
