This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading data from an Excel file ('book.xlsx') using the `roo` gem. It initializes an empty two-dimensional array (`two_dimensional`) and then reads each row from the sheet named 'mysheet' into this array. Finally, it prints the populated `two_dimensional` array, which contains the data from the Excel sheet.
