This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading data from an Excel file (`book.xlsx`) using the `roo` gem. It opens the spreadsheet, accesses a specific sheet named 'mysheet', iterates through each row of that sheet, and appends each row as an array to the `two_dimensional` array, resulting in a two-dimensional array representation of the Excel sheet's data.
