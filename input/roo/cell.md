This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to use the Roo gem to read data from an Excel file. The `require 'roo'` line at the top of the script loads the Roo library, which provides a simple and flexible way to read data from various spreadsheet formats.

The next line, `xlsx = Roo::Excelx.new('input/roo/book.xlsx')`, creates an instance of the Excelx class, which is one of the built-in classes that Roo provides for reading Excel files. The constructor takes a path to the file as its argument.

The next line, `sh1 = xlsx.sheet('mysheet')`, gets the first sheet in the Excel file and stores it in a variable called `sh1`. Sheets are numbered starting from 0, so this code retrieves the first sheet in the workbook.

The following lines retrieve data from specific cells in the sheet:
```ruby
sh1.cell(1,1)
sh1.cell(1,2)
```
These lines get the values of the first two cells in the first row of the sheet. The `cell` method takes two arguments: the row number and the column number. In this case, we're getting the values of cells A1 and B1 (i.e., the first cell in the first row and the second cell in the first row).

The next line, `sh1.last_row`, retrieves the last row in the sheet. This is useful if you want to loop through all the rows in a sheet without knowing how many there are.

The final line, `sh1.last_column`, retrieves the last column in the sheet. This is useful if you want to loop through all the columns in a sheet without knowing how many there are.

Note that this code only demonstrates reading data from Excel files using Roo. To write data to an Excel file, you would need to use a different library or method.
