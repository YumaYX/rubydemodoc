This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading data from an Excel file named 'book.xlsx' using the `roo` gem. It opens the specified Excel file, accesses a sheet named 'mysheet', and then retrieves the values of two cells (1,1) and (1,2) which are "key" and "value" respectively. Finally, it gets the last row and column numbers of the sheet, which are 7 and 2.
