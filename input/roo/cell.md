This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to interact with an Excel file using the `roo` gem. First, the `require 'roo'` statement loads the necessary library. Then, `Roo::Excelx.new('input/roo/book.xlsx')` initializes an Excelx object, specifying the path to the Excel file named "book.xlsx" located within the "input/roo" directory. Subsequently, `sh1 = xlsx.sheet('mysheet')` accesses a specific sheet named "mysheet" within the Excel file, assigning it to the variable `sh1`. The code then attempts to access the cell at row 1, column 1 using `sh1.cell(1,1)`. Similarly, `sh1.cell(1,2)` attempts to access the cell at row 1, column 2. Finally, `sh1.last_row` retrieves the index of the last row in the "mysheet" sheet, and `sh1.last_column` retrieves the index of the last column in the same sheet.
