This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to interact with an Excel file using the `roo` gem. First, it requires the `roo` library. Then, it creates an `Excelsx` object, which represents the Excel workbook, by specifying the path to the Excel file ('input/roo/book.xlsx'). Next, it selects a specific sheet named 'mysheet' from the workbook. After that, it accesses cells within the sheet, specifically cell (row 1, column 1) and cell (row 1, column 2), and then retrieves the last row and last column of the sheet.
