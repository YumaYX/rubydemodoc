 This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the Roo gem to read data from an Excel spreadsheet in XLSX format. The first line imports the Roo library, which provides a convenient interface for reading and writing Excel files.

The second line creates a new instance of the Roo::Excelx class, which represents the Excel file being opened. The file is located at 'input/roo/book.xlsx'.

The third line retrieves a reference to a sheet in the Excel file by its name, using the sheet() method. In this case, the sheet's name is 'mysheet'.

The fourth and fifth lines retrieve the value of the cell at row 1 and column 1 (the upper left-hand corner) and column 2 (the cell immediately to the right of it). The last_row() method retrieves the number of rows in the sheet, while the last_column() method retrieves the number of columns.
