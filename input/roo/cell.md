This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the usage of the `roo` gem to read data from an Excelx file (`book.xlsx`). It first requires the gem, then opens the Excel file. After that, it accesses a specific sheet named 'mysheet', and reads the value of a cell at row 1, column 1 ("key") and row 1, column 2 ("value"). Finally, it determines the last row (7) and last column (2) of the accessed sheet.
