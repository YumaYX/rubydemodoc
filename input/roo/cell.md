This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `roo` gem to read data from an Excel file. First, it loads the Excel file named 'book.xlsx' located in the 'input/roo' directory and assigns it to the variable `xlsx`. Then, it accesses the worksheet named 'mysheet' within the Excel file and assigns it to the variable `sh1`. The code then accesses the cell at row 1, column 1 and row 1, column 2 of the worksheet `sh1`. After that, it retrieves the last row and last column of the worksheet `sh1` and assigns them to the respective variables. In essence, this code reads the structure of the specified Excel sheet, including the number of rows and columns.
