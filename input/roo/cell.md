This Ruby code snippet demonstrates working with Excel files using the `roo` gem. It initializes an `Roo::Excelx` object from an Excel file named 'book.xlsx', accesses a sheet named 'mysheet', retrieves values from specific cells (e.g., `sh1.cell(1,1)`), gets the last row and last column of the sheet.
