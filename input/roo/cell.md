This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to work with an Excel spreadsheet using the `roo` library. Specifically, it initializes an Excel spreadsheet object named `xlsx` from a file called `book.xlsx`. Then, it accesses a sheet named 'mysheet' within the spreadsheet. It retrieves the cell at row 1, column 1, and also accesses the last row and last column of the sheet.
