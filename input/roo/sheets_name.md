This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to use the `roo` gem to interact with an Excel file. Specifically, it loads an Excel file named "book.xlsx" located in the "input/roo" directory using the `Roo::Excelx.new` method. The `xlsx.sheets` command then retrieves and lists all the sheet names within the loaded Excel file, providing a list of the available worksheets for further processing or analysis within the Ruby program.
