This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `roo` gem to read data from an Excelx file (`book.xlsx`). It first requires the `roo` library. Then, it opens the Excelx file using `Roo::Excelx.new`. Finally, it retrieves a list of sheet names present in the Excel file using `xlsx.sheets`, resulting in an array containing "mysheet" and "mysheet2".
