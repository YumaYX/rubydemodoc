This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `roo` gem to read an Excel file. The code first requires the `roo` gem, which provides functionality for reading and writing Excel files. Then, it creates a new `Roo::Excels` object, specifying the path to the Excel file ('input/roo/book.xlsx'). Finally, it calls the `sheets` method on the `xlsx` object. This method returns an array containing the names of all the sheets in the Excel file. 

In essence, this code snippet is designed to retrieve a list of sheet names from an Excel file using the `roo` gem. This is a common task when working with Excel files, as it allows you to iterate over the different sheets and process the data in each one.
