 This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `Roo::Excelx` class to read an Excel file with the `.xlsx` extension. The `require` statement at the beginning imports the `Roo` library, which is a popular Ruby library for reading and writing spreadsheet files. The next line creates a new instance of the `Roo::Excelx` class by passing the path to the input file as an argument. The `sheets` method returns an array containing the names of all the worksheets in the Excel file.
