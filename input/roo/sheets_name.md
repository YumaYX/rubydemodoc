This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to use the `roo` gem to interact with an Excel spreadsheet. Specifically, it initializes the `Roo::Excelx` class, referencing the file 'input/roo/book.xlsx', which presumably is an Excel file created with Microsoft Excel or a similar program. After this initialization, the `xlsx.sheets` method is called, which is designed to return an array containing the names of all the sheets within the specified Excel file. This functionality allows for programmatic access and manipulation of spreadsheets.
