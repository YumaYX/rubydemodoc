This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `File.foreach` method to iterate over lines in a file and perform an action on each line. The `do |line1|` block is executed for each line in the 'input/file/foreach_b.txt' file, and inside that block, another `File.foreach` method is used to iterate over lines in the 'input/file/foreach_a.txt' file. If a matching line between both files is found, the code will print "MATCHED: #line1".
