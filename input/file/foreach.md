This Ruby code snippet demonstrates a nested loop structure designed to compare each line from `foreach_b.txt` against every line in `foreach_a.txt`. The outer loop iterates through each line of `foreach_b.txt`, while the inner loop iterates through each line of `foreach_a.txt`. Inside the inner loop, the `eql?` method is used to compare the current line from `foreach_b.txt` with each line in `foreach_a.txt`. If a match is found, the message "MATCHED: #{line1}" is printed to the console, and the inner loop is immediately terminated using the `break` statement.
