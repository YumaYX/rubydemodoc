This Ruby code snippet demonstrates nested file processing and string comparison. The code iterates through the lines of two files, 'input/file/foreach_b.txt' and 'input/file/foreach_a.txt', using `File.foreach`. The outer loop iterates through each line of the first file (`foreaach_b.txt`), and the inner loop iterates through each line of the second file (`foreaach_a.txt`). Inside the inner loop, it compares the current line from the first file (`line1`) with the current line from the second file (`line2`) using the `eql?` method, which likely performs a string comparison. If the lines are equal, it prints a message "MATCHED: " followed by the matching line from the first file and then breaks out of the inner loop. The outer loop continues processing the remaining lines of the first file. In essence, the code checks for matching lines between the two input files and prints the matched lines.
