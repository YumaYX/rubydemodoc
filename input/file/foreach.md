This Ruby code snippet demonstrates nested file processing. It reads lines from two files, `foreaach_a.txt` and `foreaach_b.txt`. It compares each line in `foreaach_b.txt` with each line in `foreaach_a.txt`. If a match is found, it prints "MATCHED: " followed by the matching line from `foreaach_b.txt` and then breaks out of the inner loop. The output indicates that lines "9", "2", and "6" from `foreaach_b.txt` matched lines in `foreaach_a.txt`.
