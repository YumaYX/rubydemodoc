This Ruby code snippet demonstrates nested file reading to compare each line of `foreach_b.txt` with every line in `foreach_a.txt`. It prints "MATCHED: [line1]" if a match is found, and exits the inner loop. The `break` statement ensures that only the first match for each line in `foreach_b.txt` is printed.  The `#=> nil` indicates that no further output occurred after the initial matches were found, essentially meaning the loops completed without any additional matches being reported.
