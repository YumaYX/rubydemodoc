This Ruby code snippet demonstrates a nested iteration process designed to find matches between lines from two files, `foreach_a.txt` and `foreach_b.txt`. The outer loop iterates through each line within the file `foreach_b.txt`, assigning each line to the variable `line1`.  For each `line1`, the inner loop iterates through every line in the file `foreach_a.txt`, assigning each line to the variable `line2`.  Inside the inner loop, an equality check (`line1.eql?(line2)`) is performed, comparing the contents of `line1` and `line2`.  If the lines are identical, the code prints a message "MATCHED: #{line1}" to the console, indicating a match, and then immediately exits the inner loop using `break`. This ensures that once a matching line is found from `foreach_a.txt` for a given line in `foreach_b.txt`, the process continues to the next line in `foreach_b.txt` rather than continuing to search through the remaining lines in `foreach_a.txt`. Essentially, the code searches for identical lines between the two files.
