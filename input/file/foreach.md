This Ruby code snippet demonstrates nested `File.foreach` loops that iterate through lines of two different text files, 'input/file/foreach_a.txt' and 'input/file/foreach_b.txt'. The outer loop iterates through each line in 'input/file/foreach_b.txt', assigning each line to the variable `line1`.  The inner loop then iterates through each line in 'input/file/foreach_a.txt', assigning each line to the variable `line2`. Inside the inner loop, an `if` statement checks if `line1` is equal to `line2` using the `eql?` method. If the lines are equal, the code prints the string "MATCHED:" followed by the content of `line1` to the console.
