This Ruby code snippet demonstrates a nested loop designed to compare each line from a file named `foreach_b.txt` with every line in a file named `foreach_a.txt`. The outer loop iterates through each line (`line1`) within the `foreach_b.txt` file.  For each `line1`, the inner loop iterates through all lines (`line2`) in the `foreach_a.txt` file. Inside the inner loop, the `if line1.eql?(line2)` statement checks if the current line from `foreach_b.txt` is exactly equal to the current line from `foreach_a.txt`. If a match is found, the code prints "MATCHED: #{line1}" to the console, and then immediately exits the inner loop using `break`. This ensures that once a match is identified, the code does not continue comparing the remaining lines in `foreach_a.txt` for that particular line from `foreach_b.txt`. The code effectively searches for identical lines between the two files.
