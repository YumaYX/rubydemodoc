This Ruby code snippet demonstrates nested file iteration to find matching lines between two files ('foreach_a.txt' and 'foreach_b.txt'). It iterates through each line of 'foreach_b.txt', and for each line, it iterates through 'foreach_a.txt'. If a line matches between the two files, it prints "MATCHED" along with the matching line and breaks the inner loop, effectively finding the *first* match for each line in 'foreach_b.txt'. The output shows three matching lines ("9", "2", and "6") were found. The final `nil` is the implicit return value of the outer loop after completion.
