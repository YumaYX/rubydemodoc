This Ruby code snippet demonstrates comparing each line of 'foreach_b.txt' with every line in 'foreach_a.txt'. When a match is found, it prints "MATCHED: [matched line]" and breaks out of the inner loop. The output shows the lines "9", "2", and "6" as they were found to match lines within 'foreach_a.txt'.
