This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read a file using the `File` class in Ruby. The method `read` is used to read the contents of the file and return it as a string. The argument passed to the `read` method is the path to the file that needs to be read. In this example, the file "input/file/filewr.txt" is being read.
