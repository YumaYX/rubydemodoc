This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading the entire content of a file named "filewr.txt" located in the "input/file" directory. The `File.read()` method opens the specified file and reads all of its contents into a single string. This string is then returned by the method.  The returned string can be stored in a variable or used directly for further processing.
