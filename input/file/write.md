This Ruby code snippet demonstrates writing the string "Hello" to a file named "filewr.txt" located in the "input/file" directory. The `File.write` method takes two arguments: the path to the file and the string to be written. If the file does not exist, it will be created. If the file exists, its contents will be overwritten with the new string.
