This Ruby code snippet demonstrates writing the string "Hello" to a file named "filewr.txt" located within the "input/file" directory. The `File.write` method writes the specified string to the given file path, creating the file if it doesn't already exist or overwriting it if it does. Note that the file path is specified as a relative path from the current working directory.
