 This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read a file line by line and remove the newline character from each line using the `chomp` method. The `readlines` method reads the contents of a file into an array, where each element is a string representing one line of the file. The `&:` notation is used to pass the `chomp` method as a block to the `map` method, which applies the method to each element in the array and returns a new array with the modified elements. In this case, the `chomp` method removes the newline character from each line of the file, resulting in an array where each element is a string without the newline character at the end.
