This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading all lines from a file named 'file.txt' located within the 'input/file' directory, removing any trailing whitespace characters (like newlines) from each line, and then returning a new array containing these cleaned lines. The `File.readlines('input/file/file.txt')` part reads the file line by line, converting each line into a string. Subsequently, the `.map(&:chomp)` method is applied to iterate over each string in the resulting array and uses the `chomp` method to remove the trailing newline character from each line, effectively producing a new array with clean, whitespace-free strings.
