This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading all lines from a file named "file.txt" located in the "input/file/" directory, and then removing any trailing whitespace characters (specifically, newline characters) from each line. It achieves this through a chained sequence of operations: first, `File.readlines('input/file/file.txt')` reads the contents of the file as an array of strings, where each string represents a line from the file. Then, `.map(&:chomp)` iterates through this array of strings and applies the `chomp` method to each string. The `chomp` method removes the trailing newline character (`\n`) from the end of each line, returning a new array of strings without the whitespace. Therefore, the resulting array contains the lines of the file, each with its trailing newline character removed.
