This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading lines from a file, removing trailing whitespace, and then processing those lines. The `File.readlines('input/file/file.txt')` part reads all lines from the file located at the specified path ('input/file/file.txt') and returns them as an array of strings, where each string includes the newline character at the end. The `.map(&:chomp)` part then iterates over each string in the array and calls the `chomp` method on it. The `chomp` method removes any trailing whitespace, including the newline character, from the end of each string. Therefore, the entire code snippet reads the lines from the file, removes the trailing newline characters, and returns a new array containing the processed lines.
