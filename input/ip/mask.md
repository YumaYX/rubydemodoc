This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `IPAddr` class to create an IP address object (`255.255.255.255/32`) and then iterates 33 times, generating and printing progressively larger subnet masks (from 0 to 32 bits) for that IP address using the `mask()` method.  The output shows how the mask changes the network portion of the IP address.
