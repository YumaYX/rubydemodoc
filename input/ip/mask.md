This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to use the `IPAddr` class from the `ipaddr` library to perform IP address manipulation tasks. The code first creates a new instance of the `IPAddr` class and initializes it with an IPv4 address in CIDR notation (e.g., `'255.255.255.255/32'`).

The next line of code uses a block to iterate over 33 different masks, where each mask is applied to the IP address using the `mask` method and the result is printed to the console using `puts`. The numbering of the masks starts at 0 and goes up to 32.

The use of this code snippet can be helpful in scenarios where you need to perform various IP address manipulation tasks, such as creating subnets, finding available IP addresses within a range, or performing other operations that require manipulating IP addresses.
