This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to use the `IPAddr` class in the `ipaddr` gem to create an IP address object and generate a sequence of subnet masks for it.

The code first requires the `ipaddr` gem by calling `require 'ipaddr'`. It then creates an instance of the `IPAddr` class with the string `'255.255.255.255/32'` using the constructor method `new()`. The resulting object, stored in the variable `ip`, is then used to generate a sequence of subnet masks by calling the `mask()` method 33 times and passing each time the index of the iteration as an argument.

Inside the block passed to `times()`, the `puts` method is called with two arguments: the current value of the index (`i`) and the result of the `mask()` method call for that index, which returns a string representation of the subnet mask. The resulting output is displayed on the console.

The resulting subnet mask sequence will be in CIDR format (e.g., '255.255.255.255/32') and will include 33 different values, each representing a different subnet mask with a prefix length of 32.
