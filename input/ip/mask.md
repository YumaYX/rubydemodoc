This Ruby code snippet uses the `ipaddr` library to create an IPv4 address object from the string "255.255.255.255/32", which represents the all-zeros broadcast address. It then iterates 33 times, calculating and printing the IP address mask for each byte position (0-31) of the IP address. The output shows the corresponding IP address at each byte position, where the first octet is always 255 and subsequent octets progressively increase, culminating in the full broadcast address (255.255.255.255) at the 32nd iteration.
