This code calculates and prints the IP address mask for various subnet bit positions (0 to 32) of the IP address 255.255.255.255/32.

It iterates from 0 to 32, representing the number of set bits in the subnet mask. For each iteration, it uses the `ip.mask()` method to create a new IP address object with that many set bits in the subnet mask. Then, it prints the iteration number and the resulting IP address with the updated mask.
