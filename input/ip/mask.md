This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `ipaddr` gem to create and manipulate IP addresses. It initializes an `IPAddr` object with the address `255.255.255.255/32` and then iterates 33 times, printing the IP address with various subnet masks, showcasing how the subnet mask influences the resulting IP address.
