This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `ipaddr` gem to create and manipulate IP addresses. It initializes an IP address object with the value '255.255.255.255/32' and then iterates 33 times, printing the IP address and its corresponding mask for each iteration. The mask function is used to display the address within the network and host portions.
