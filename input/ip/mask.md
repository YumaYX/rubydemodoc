This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to work with IP addresses using the `ipaddr` library. Specifically, it initializes an IP address object representing `255.255.255.255/32` and then iterates 33 times, printing the iteration number along with the IP address after applying a mask to the given number. The loop uses the `ipaddr` library's `mask` method to create a new IP address object with a specific subnet mask, effectively changing the network portion of the IP address.
