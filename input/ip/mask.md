This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to represent and manipulate IP addresses using the `ipaddr` library.  It first requires the `ipaddr` library, which provides tools for working with IP addresses and networks.  Then, it creates an `IPAddr` object representing the IP address `255.255.255.255` with a /32 subnet mask, indicating a single host. Finally, the code iterates 33 times, printing the loop counter (`i`) along with the result of calling the `mask` method on the `ip` object with the current counter value. This `mask` method returns an `IPAddr` object representing the IP address after applying the specified subnet mask. Therefore, the output will show the sequence of numbers from 0 to 32, each paired with the corresponding IP address after applying a /32 subnet mask.
