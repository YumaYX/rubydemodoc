This Ruby code snippet demonstrates functions for summarizing IP addresses into CIDR blocks, converting CIDR blocks to ACL entries, and generating netmasks from mask values. It utilizes the `IPAddr` class for IP address manipulation and range calculations. The code includes functions like `summarize_ips`, `cidrs_to_acl`, `mask_to_netmask`, `cidr_to_acl`, `largest_block`, and `range_to_cidrs` to achieve this.
