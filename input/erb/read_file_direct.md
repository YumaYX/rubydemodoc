This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `ERB` (Embedded Ruby) template engine. It first requires the `erb` library. Then, it reads the contents of an ERB file (`file.html.erb`), creates an `ERB` object from it, and evaluates the template using the current `binding`. The result is a string containing the rendered HTML, in this case a header and an empty paragraph.
