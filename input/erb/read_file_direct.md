This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the ERB (Embedded Ruby) library to evaluate and render a Ruby template file. Specifically, it reads the contents of the file named 'input/erb/file.html.erb' using `File.read`, then creates an ERB object from that content. The `.result(binding)` method is then called on the ERB object, which processes the ERB code within the template file, making the Ruby code within the template executable.  In essence, the code reads the HTML template, executes any embedded Ruby code (like variable substitutions or logic), and then returns the rendered HTML as a string.
