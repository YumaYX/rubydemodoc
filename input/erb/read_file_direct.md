This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `erb` library to render an HTML file. The code first requires the `erb` library, which is used for executing ERB (Embedded Ruby) templates. It then reads the content of the file 'input/erb/file.html.erb' and passes it to the `ERB.new` constructor. The `ERB.new` constructor creates an ERB object, which is then used to render the template against the current binding. The `result` method returns the rendered HTML string, which is then likely used to output to the console or save to a file. Essentially, this code reads an ERB template, executes the embedded Ruby code within it, and generates the final HTML output.
