This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the ERB (Embedded Ruby) class to process a template file. Specifically, it reads the content of the file `input/erb/file.html.erb` using `File.read`. Then, it initializes an ERB object with the read content. Finally, it calls the `result` method on the ERB object, passing the `binding` variable. The `binding` variable provides access to the current scope (the `binding`) where the code is executed. The `result` method then evaluates the ERB template, substituting any Ruby expressions with their values, and returns the final result, which is likely the rendered HTML content.
