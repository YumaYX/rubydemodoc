This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to use the ERB (Embedded Ruby) module in Ruby to parse and render an HTML file that contains embedded Ruby code. The `ERB.new` method is used to create a new instance of the ERB class, passing in the path to the HTML file as an argument. The `File.read` method is then used to read the contents of the file into memory, and the `result` method is called on the instance of the ERB class to render the template with the embedded Ruby code. Finally, the resulting HTML document is output to the console using the `puts` method.

Note: The `binding` argument passed to the `result` method allows for the evaluation of any Ruby code present in the ERB tags.
