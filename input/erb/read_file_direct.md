This code uses Ruby's ERB (Embedded Ruby) engine to process a template file (`file.html.erb`). 

*   **`require 'erb'`**:  Loads the ERB library, which provides the functionality for parsing and executing Ruby code within HTML templates.
*   **`ERB.new(File.read('input/erb/file.html.erb'))`**: Creates a new ERB object, reading the contents of the specified HTML file.
*   **.result(binding)**:  Executes the ERB template, replacing placeholders (like `<%= expression %>`) with their evaluated results.  `binding` provides access to the current Ruby environment, allowing the template to access variables and execute code.
