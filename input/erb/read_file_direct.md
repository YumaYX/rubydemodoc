This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `erb` library to render an HTML template. It reads the content of an ERB file (`input/erb/file.html.erb`), compiles it into an executable object, and then renders it using the current `binding` (context). The code effectively extracts the rendered HTML content, which in this example is a simple header and paragraph.
