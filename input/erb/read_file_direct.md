This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the ERB (Embedded Ruby) library to render a template file. The `require 'erb'` statement loads the necessary library for working with ERB templates.  `ERB.new(File.read('input/erb/file.html.erb'))` creates a new ERB object, reading the content of the `file.html.erb` file located in the `input/erb` directory. The `.result(binding)` method then executes the ERB template, effectively evaluating any Ruby code embedded within the template.  This allows the template's logic and variables to be processed and rendered, typically resulting in the generation of HTML output.
