 This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to use the ERB (Embedded Ruby) templating engine to render a template file and substitute variables with values in a binding.

The first line, `require 'erb'`, imports the ERB library into the current Ruby environment.

The second line, `ERB.new(File.read('input/erb/file.html.erb'))`, creates an instance of the ERB class using the contents of a template file located at `input/erb/file.html.erb`. The `ERB` class is used to parse and render ERB templates.

The third line, `.result(binding)`, renders the template with the variables in the current binding. The `binding` object represents the local variable environment of the Ruby script that it is called from. When passed as an argument to the `result` method, it allows the ERB template to access and use the variables defined in the script.

For example, if we have a template file located at `input/erb/file.html.erb` with the following content:
```
<h1>Hello <%= @name %></h1>
```
And a Ruby script with the following code:
```
require 'erb'

@name = "John"
ERB.new(File.read('input/erb/file.html.erb')).result(binding)
```
The ERB template will be rendered with the variable `@name` substituted with its value, resulting in a HTML file with the following content:
```
<h1>Hello John</h1>
```
This is just one way to use the ERB library and is not an exhaustive list of all the features available. For more information about the ERB templating engine and its capabilities, please refer to the official Ruby documentation.
