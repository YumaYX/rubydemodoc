This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `erb` library to render an HTML template. The code first requires the `erb` library, which is used for executing ERB (Embedded Ruby) templates. Then, it reads the content of the file 'input/erb/file.html.erb' and passes it to the `Erb.new` constructor.  The `Erb.new` method creates a new ERB object, and the `result` method executes the template, using the current binding as the context. The result of the template rendering is then implicitly returned by the `result` method. In essence, this code reads an ERB template file and generates HTML output by evaluating the Ruby code embedded within the template.
