This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `erb` library to render an HTML template. The code first requires the `erb` library, which is used for executing ERB (Embedded Ruby) templates. It then creates an `ERB` object, initializing it with the content of an HTML file located at 'input/erb/file.html.erb'.  Next, it defines a variable `@val` with the string value 'val'. Finally, it calls the `result` method on the `ERB` object, passing in the current binding. This renders the ERB template, substituting the value of `@val` into the template and returning the resulting HTML string.
