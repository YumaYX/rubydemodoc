 This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `ERB` module to parse an HTML template file and generate a new HTML file with the dynamic data injected.

The first line of code, `require 'erb'`, loads the ERB module from the standard library.

The second line of code, `erb = ERB.new(File.read('input/erb/file.html.erb'))`, creates a new instance of the `ERB` class and reads the contents of the file `'input/erb/file.html.erb'` into memory. The `ERB` class is used to parse HTML templates with embedded Ruby code, allowing you to inject dynamic data into the template.

The third line of code, `@val = 'val'`, sets a variable named `@val` to the string `'val'`. This variable will be used in the template to demonstrate how to insert dynamic data into the HTML output.

The fourth line of code, `erb.result(binding)`, uses the `result` method of the `ERB` instance to generate an HTML file from the template. The `binding` object is passed as an argument to the `result` method, which allows the template to access variables defined in the surrounding context (in this case, the `@val` variable).

The generated HTML file will contain the dynamic data from the `@val` variable inserted into the template. For example, if the value of `@val` is `'hello'`, the resulting HTML file would contain the text 'hello' somewhere within it.
