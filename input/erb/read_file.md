This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `ERB` (Embedded Ruby) library to render a template file. The code first requires the `erb` library, which provides the functionality to execute Ruby code within an HTML template.  Then, it creates an `ERB` object named `erb` by reading the contents of the file `input/erb/file.html.erb` using `File.read`.  Next, a variable `@val` is initialized with the value 'val'.  Finally, the `erb.result(binding)` method is called, which evaluates the Ruby code within the template, substituting the value of `@val` into the template during the rendering process, and returning the resulting HTML string.
