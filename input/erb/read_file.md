This code uses the `ERB` (Embedded Ruby) library to render an HTML template. Here's a breakdown:

*   **`require 'erb'`**:  This line loads the `erb` gem, making the ERB functionality available in your Ruby script.
*   **`erb = ERB.new(File.read('input/erb/file.html.erb'))`**:  This creates a new ERB object. The `File.read('input/erb/file.html.erb')` part reads the contents of the `file.html.erb` file (located in the `input/erb` directory) as a string. This string is then passed to the `ERB.new` constructor, which creates an object that can be used to evaluate Ruby code within the template file.
*   **`@val = 'val'`**: This line defines a Ruby variable named `@val` and sets its value to the string "val". This variable can be used within the template file.
*   **`erb.result(binding)`**: This line evaluates the ERB template using the current Ruby context. `binding` provides the scope of the Ruby code, allowing the template to access the variables defined in the script (like `@val`) and execute any Ruby code embedded in the template. The result of the evaluation is a string containing the rendered HTML.

In essence, the code reads an HTML template, allows the template to access a variable `@val` defined in the surrounding Ruby code, and renders the template into a string.
