This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to use the `ERB` module in Ruby to process an HTML template file that contains ERB tags. The code first reads the contents of an HTML file using the `File.read` method and then uses the `ERB.new` method to create a new instance of the `ERB` class with the given template.

The `@val` variable is used to store the value that will be inserted into the ERB tags in the template. The `result` method is called on the `erb` object, passing it a binding that contains the value of `@val`. The `binding` parameter allows the code to access the instance variables of the current scope.

When the `result` method is called, the `ERB` class will replace all ERB tags in the template with the corresponding values from the binding. In this case, it will replace `<%= @val %>` with `'val'`. The resulting HTML output is then returned as a string.
