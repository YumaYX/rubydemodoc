This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `ERB` library for embedding Ruby code within HTML templates. It reads an ERB file, creates an `ERB` object, sets a variable `@val` to "val", and then uses the `result` method to render the template, outputting an HTML fragment with the variable's value.
