This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the ERB (Embedded Ruby) library to render a template file. Specifically, it loads the contents of a file named `file.html.erb` using the `File.read` function.  An instance of the `ERB` class is then created from the file's contents.  A variable `@val` is initialized with the string value 'val'. Finally, the `erb.result(binding)` method is called, which evaluates the ERB code within the current Ruby scope and renders the template, incorporating the value of the `@val` variable into the generated output.
