This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the ERB (Embedded Ruby) library for template processing. Specifically, it reads the content of the file `input/erb/file.html.erb` using the `File.read` method. Then, it initializes an ERB object named `erb` with the read content. It also sets a variable named `@val` to the string 'val'. Finally, the `erb.result(binding)` method is called, which evaluates the code within the `binding` object (which represents the current execution context) within the ERB template, effectively rendering the template with the value of `@val` substituted into it.
