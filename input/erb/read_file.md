This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `ERB` (Embedded Ruby) template engine. It reads an ERB file (`file.html.erb`), defines a Ruby variable `@val`, and then renders the ERB template using the current object's binding, effectively substituting the variable into the template and producing a string output.  The `require 'erb'` line loads the ERB library, and `erb.result(binding)` executes the ERB template with access to the local variables.
