This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the ERB (Embedded Ruby) library to render an HTML template. It reads an HTML template from a file (`input/erb/file.html.erb`), initializes an ERB object, sets a variable `@val` to "val", and then uses the `result` method to render the template, substituting the `@val` variable into the HTML. The output is an HTML string containing a header and a paragraph with the value "val".
