This Ruby code snippet demonstrates string interpolation within a heredoc. The code initializes a string variable named `value` to the string "ruby".  Then, a heredoc (denoted by `<<~EOL`) is used to create a multi-line string. Inside the heredoc, the value of the `value` variable is embedded directly into the string using the `#{}` interpolation syntax. The `EOL` marker is simply a string literal that marks the end of the heredoc, and it is included as part of the resulting string.  The final result will be the string "ruby".
