This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of heredocs (triple-quoted strings) in Ruby. The `<<~EOL` construct is used to define a heredoc, which is a string that spans multiple lines and can contain arbitrary text. The `#{value}` syntax is used to interpolate the value of the `value` variable into the heredoc. The resulting `doc` variable will be assigned a string with the value of `ruby`.
