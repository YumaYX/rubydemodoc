This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of a heredoc string to define a string literal. The code initializes a string variable `value` to the string "ruby". Then, it uses a heredoc string (denoted by `<<~EOL`) to create a multiline string. Within the heredoc, the value of the `value` variable is embedded directly into the string. The `EOL` marker at the end of the heredoc signifies the end of the string.
