This Ruby code snippet demonstrates string interpolation and a heredoc. It assigns the string "ruby" to the variable `value`. Then, it uses a heredoc (`<<~EOL`) to define a multi-line string. Within the heredoc, `#{value}` interpolates the value of the `value` variable, resulting in a string containing "ruby" followed by a newline character.
