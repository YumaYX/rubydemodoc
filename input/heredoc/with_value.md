This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to use the "<<~" operator to create a heredoc (i.e., a here document) in Ruby. The "<<~" operator is used to specify that the following indented lines should be treated as a heredoc, which allows for more readable and flexible formatting of text.

In this code snippet, we define a variable `value` with the value `'ruby'`, and then use the "<<~" operator to create a heredoc with the same name (`doc`). The heredoc is assigned the value of the indented lines following it, which in this case is just the string `'ruby'`.

Note that the heredoc is defined by indenting the lines below the "<<~" operator. The indentation should be consistent throughout the heredoc, and should not contain any leading or trailing whitespace. Additionally, the heredoc should not be terminated with a line break.
