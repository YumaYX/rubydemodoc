This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to assign a string to a variable named `doc` using a heredoc. A heredoc allows you to define multi-line strings in a readable way. In this case, the string "string" is assigned to the variable `doc`, which is then enclosed within the heredoc delimiters (`<<~'EOL'` and `EOL`). The `EOL` marker indicates the end of the string definition.
