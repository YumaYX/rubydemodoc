 This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to use a here document to assign a string value to a variable named `doc`. The here document is denoted by the `<<` and `EOL` markers, which indicate that the text between them should be treated as a single string.

Here is an example of how this code might be used:
```
doc = <<~'EOL'
  This is a string with multiple lines.
  It can contain anything you want, including special characters like $ or @.
EOL
puts doc
```
This code would output the following string to the console:
```
This is a string with multiple lines.
It can contain anything you want, including special characters like $ or @.
```
