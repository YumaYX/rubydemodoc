This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the heredoc syntax, specifically the `<<~` operator, for defining a multiline string. The `<<~` operator is a shorthand way to create a string literal that can contain arbitrary content, including newline characters, without needing to explicitly escape them. The string defined within the heredoc, enclosed by `EOL` markers, is assigned to the variable `doc`. This is a common technique for writing strings with embedded newlines for improved readability and maintainability.
