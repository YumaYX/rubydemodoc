This Ruby code snippet demonstrates a heredoc string literal. It assigns the string "string\n" to the variable `doc`. Heredocs allow multi-line strings to be defined without needing to escape newlines, making them useful for embedding larger blocks of text. The `<<~` operator strips leading whitespace from each line within the heredoc.
