This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to assign a string to a variable named `doc` using a heredoc. A heredoc allows you to define a multi-line string literal. In this case, the string "string" is assigned to the variable `doc`, and the heredoc syntax `<<~'EOL'` indicates that the string will be treated as a single string literal until it encounters the delimiter "EOL". The code effectively creates a string variable containing the text "string".
