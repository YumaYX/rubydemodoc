This Ruby code snippet demonstrates iterating through an array of hashes, extracting data from each hash (specifically `:id`, `:val1`, and `:val2`), and printing the data in a tabular format. It pads shorter arrays with empty strings to align the output and prints the `id` only on the first line for each entry. The code effectively processes the `data` array and presents it in a readable, aligned format, handling cases where the `val1` and `val2` arrays have different lengths.
