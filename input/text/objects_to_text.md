This Ruby code snippet demonstrates processing an array of hashes, where each hash represents data with `id`, `val1`, and `val2` keys. It then prints the keys of the first entry, followed by iterating through the array, constructing and printing formatted output lines with the `id`, `val1`, and `val2` values, padding with empty strings where values are missing.
