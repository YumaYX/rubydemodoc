This Ruby code snippet demonstrates iterating through an array of hashes, extracting values based on their indices, and printing them with a tab delimiter. It first prints the keys of the first element as a tab-separated string. Then, it iterates through each element, extracting the `id`, `val1`, and `val2` values based on their index, handling potential nil values by using empty strings and printing these extracted values separated by tabs. Finally, it prints the output.
