This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `each` method to iterate over an array of hashes. The code first retrieves the keys of the first hash in the array using the `first` method, and then joins them with tabs using the `join` method.

The next step is to iterate over each hash in the array using the `each` method, which passes a block with the variable `entry` bound to each element in the array. Inside the block, the code retrieves the values of the `:id`, `:val1`, and `:val2` keys from the current entry using the `[]` method, and then computes the maximum length of the arrays for `:val1` and `:val2`.

The code then iterates over each element in the array using a loop that runs up to the maximum length. Inside the loop, it retrieves the value of the `:id` key from the current entry if `i` is 0 (the first iteration), or an empty string otherwise. It also retrieves the value of the `:val1` and `:val2` keys using the same method as before, but only if the element exists in the array at the current index.

Finally, it joins the values with tabs and outputs them to the console using `puts`. This code demonstrates how to iterate over an array of hashes and retrieve values from each entry based on specific keys.
