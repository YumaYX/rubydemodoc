This Ruby code snippet demonstrates parsing a CSV file with a Byte Order Mark (BOM) and UTF-8 encoding, and then constructing a family tree based on the data. The code first reads the CSV file into a Ruby array of hashes using `CSV.read`, specifying the `encoding: "BOM|UTF-8"` to handle the BOM and UTF-8. It then defines a `Family` class with an accessor for `children`. The code iterates through the parsed data, creating `Family` instances when a `parent` key is present, and appending `child` values to the `children` array of the appropriate family. Finally, the code returns the `arr` array, which contains all the created `Family` objects.
