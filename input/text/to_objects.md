This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading data from a CSV file, parsing it into a nested array of hashes representing a family tree, and structuring the data into a `Family` class with a list of children. It reads a CSV file, processes each row to create `Family` objects based on the "parent" and "child" columns, and ultimately returns an array of `Family` objects.
