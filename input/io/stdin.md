This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading the standard input line by line and printing each line to the console. The code first requires the "English" library, although it doesn't actually use any English-specific features. It then enters a `while` loop that continuously reads a line from the standard input stream (`$DEFAULT_IINPUT`) and prints it to the console using the `p` command. The loop continues until there are no more lines to read.  This is a simple way to process input from a pipe or user input, line by line.
