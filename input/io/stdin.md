This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading all data from the standard input stream. The `stdin.read` method in Ruby is used to read the entire contents of the standard input, which typically comes from the user's keyboard.  It reads everything until the user presses Enter or the input stream is closed, and then returns the collected data as a single string.
