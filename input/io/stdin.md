 This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read input from the standard input stream (STDIN) using the `$stdin.read` method. STDIN is a predefined file object in Ruby that represents the standard input stream, which is typically the keyboard. The `read` method reads all available data from STDIN and returns it as a string.

For example, if you run the following code:
```
puts "Enter your name: "
name = $stdin.read
puts "Hello, #{name}!"
```
and then enter "Alice" when prompted for your name, the output will be:
```
Enter your name: Alice
Hello, Alice!
```
Note that the `read` method returns all available data from STDIN, so it's important to use it in conjunction with other methods that can handle large amounts of input, such as `gets` or `scanf`. Additionally, if you are using Ruby 2.6 or later, you can also use the more concise `$stdin.readline` method instead of `$stdin.read`, which reads a single line of input from STDIN and returns it as a string.
