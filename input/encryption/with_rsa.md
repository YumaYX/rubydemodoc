This Ruby code snippet demonstrates RSA encryption and decryption using the `openssl` library. It generates a 2048-bit RSA key pair (private and public keys).  A string "Ruby" is encrypted using the public key and then successfully decrypted using the corresponding private key, showcasing the basic functionality of asymmetric encryption.
