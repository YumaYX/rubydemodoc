This Ruby code snippet demonstrates RSA encryption and decryption. First, it generates a new RSA key pair with a 2048-bit key length, consisting of a private key and a public key. Then, it defines a secret string, "Ruby". The public key is used to encrypt the secret string, resulting in encrypted data. Finally, the private key decrypts the encrypted data, recovering the original secret string. In essence, the code showcases a basic RSA encryption and decryption process using the `openssl` library.
