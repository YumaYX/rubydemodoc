This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of OpenSSL to generate an RSA key pair and encrypt/decrypt data. First, the code utilizes the `OpenSSL::PKey::RSA` class to generate a new RSA private key with a key size of 2048 bits.  Then, it extracts the corresponding public key from the private key.  The code proceeds to encrypt a string literal, "Ruby", using the public key. Finally, it decrypts the encrypted data back into its original form using the private key, confirming the encryption and decryption process works correctly.
