This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to use the OpenSSL library to generate an RSA key pair, encrypt a string, and then decrypt it back to its original form. First, the code generates a new RSA private key with a key size of 2048 bits using `OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.generate(2048)`. Then, it extracts the corresponding public key from the private key using `rsa_private.public_key`. A string "Ruby" is encrypted using the public key's `public_encrypt` method. Finally, the encrypted data is decrypted back to its original form using the private key's `private_decrypt` method.
