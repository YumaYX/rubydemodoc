This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the creation and use of an RSA key pair for encryption and decryption. First, it uses the `OpenSSL` library to generate a new RSA private key with a key size of 2048 bits. A corresponding public key is then derived from this private key. A secret string, "Ruby", is defined. The `public_encrypt` method is used to encrypt the secret string using the public key. Finally, the `private_decrypt` method is used to decrypt the encrypted data back to the original secret string using the private key, confirming the encryption and decryption process works correctly.
