This Ruby code snippet demonstrates RSA encryption and decryption. It first generates a 2048-bit RSA key pair (private and public). Then, it encrypts the string "Ruby" using the public key, producing ciphertext. Finally, it decrypts the ciphertext back to the original string "Ruby" using the private key, verifying the encryption/decryption process.
