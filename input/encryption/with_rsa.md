This Ruby code snippet demonstrates RSA encryption and decryption. First, it generates a new RSA private and public key pair with a key size of 2048 bits. Then, it defines a secret string "Ruby". The code encrypts this secret using the public key, resulting in encrypted data. Finally, it decrypts the encrypted data using the private key, recovering the original secret string "Ruby". In essence, the code showcases a basic RSA encryption and decryption process, highlighting the fundamental principle of using a public key to encrypt data and a private key to decrypt it.
