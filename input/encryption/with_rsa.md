This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to use the OpenSSL library in Ruby to perform RSA encryption and decryption. The code generates a 2048-bit RSA key pair, consisting of a private key and a public key. The private key is used for encryption, while the public key is used for decryption.

The code first creates an instance of the `OpenSSL::PKey::RSA` class with the `generate` method, passing in the number of bits to use for the RSA key pair. It then extracts the public key from the private key using the `public_key` method and stores it in a variable named `rsa_public`.

The code then defines a string variable named `secret` that contains the message to be encrypted, which is set to "Ruby".

Next, the code encrypts the message using the public key by calling the `public_encrypt` method on the `OpenSSL::PKey::RSA` instance, passing in the message to be encrypted. The resulting encrypted data is stored in a variable named `enc_data`.

Finally, the code decrypts the message using the private key by calling the `private_decrypt` method on the `OpenSSL::PKey::RSA` instance, passing in the encrypted data. The result of the decryption is printed to the console.

The output of the program will be "Ruby", which demonstrates that the encryption and decryption processes were successful.
