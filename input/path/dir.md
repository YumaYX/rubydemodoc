This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the `__dir__` method, which is a built-in method that returns a list of the names of all the public methods and constants defined in the object on which it's called. In essence, it provides a comprehensive inventory of what an object offers. It's a handy tool for introspection and debugging, allowing you to quickly see what's accessible within a particular object. It returns a list, typically as an array, containing the names of the defined items.
