This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the `__dir__` method, which is a built-in Ruby method used to return a list of symbols representing the names of all the public methods, modules, and constants defined in the object on which it is called. Essentially, it provides a comprehensive list of everything accessible from that object, making it a useful tool for introspection and debugging. It does not include private or protected members. The result is always a list of symbols, even if the object is a class or module.
