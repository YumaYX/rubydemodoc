This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read lines from standard input and print them to the console. The code first requires the "English" library, although it doesn't actually use any English-specific features. It then enters a `while` loop that continues as long as there are lines available from standard input (`$DEFAULT_INPUT`). Inside the loop, it reads a line using `gets` and prints it to the console using `p`. The loop continues until there are no more lines to read, at which point the program exits.  The example provided shows the code being run with input from the `/etc/passwd` file, and the output demonstrates that each line of the file is printed to the console.
