This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `__FILE__` constant, which is a string containing the absolute path to the current Ruby file being executed. It's a common way to include debugging information or to dynamically determine the file being run. This constant is useful in scripts and applications for logging file names, customizing behavior based on the file being executed, or generating unique identifiers.
