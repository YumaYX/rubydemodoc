This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to use the `require` method to load a module or library within a Ruby program. The `require` method takes the path of the file as an argument, and loads the contents of that file into the current program. In this case, we are loading the `json` gem, which is a standard library in Ruby, by requiring its file path.
```
require 'json'
```
The `json` gem provides functions for working with JSON data structures in Ruby, such as parsing and generating JSON strings. By requiring the `json` gem, we can use these functions within our program to work with JSON data.
