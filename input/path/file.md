This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `__FILE__` special variable, which contains the path to the current Ruby file.  It is a string that represents the absolute path of the file being executed, providing valuable information for logging, debugging, or file-related operations within a Ruby program.  The variable is automatically available in Ruby scripts and doesn't require any specific initialization.
