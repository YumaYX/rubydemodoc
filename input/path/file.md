This Ruby code snippet demonstrates a special global constant `__FILE__` which, when evaluated in an Interactive Ruby (IRB) session, returns a string representing the current file being executed. In this specific IRB context, it returns "(irb)" because the code is being executed directly within the interactive session, not from a file.  It effectively indicates the source context of execution.
