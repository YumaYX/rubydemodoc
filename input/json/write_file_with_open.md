This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to write a Ruby hash to a JSON file. It first requires the `json` library. Then, it defines a hash with a key-value pair.  Next, it opens a file named "file.json" in write mode (`'w'`) and uses `JSON.dump` to serialize the hash into JSON format and write it to the file. Finally, the file is automatically closed.
