This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to create a new JSON file with the contents of a hash variable using the `JSON` module in Ruby. The `JSON.dump()` method is used to write the contents of the hash to a new JSON file named 'file.json' in the 'input/json/' directory. The `File.open()` method is used to open a new file for writing and the block passed to it is executed with the opened file as an argument.
