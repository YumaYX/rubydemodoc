This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to write a Ruby hash to a JSON file. First, it requires the `json` library, which provides methods for working with JSON data. Then, it defines a hash with a single key-value pair: the key is "key" and the value is "value". Next, it opens a file named "input/json/file.json" in write mode (`'w'`).  A block is passed to the `File.open` method, which ensures the file is properly closed afterward. Inside the block, the `JSON.dump` method is used to serialize the hash into a JSON string and write it to the opened file. The `JSON.dump` method takes two arguments: the data to be serialized (in this case, the `hash`) and the file object where the JSON string should be written.
