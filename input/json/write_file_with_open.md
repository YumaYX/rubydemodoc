This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to create a JSON file. First, the `require 'json'` statement loads the JSON library, which provides functions for working with JSON data in Ruby.  Then, a hash named `hash` is created with a single key-value pair, where the key is "key" and the value is "value".  Next, the `File.open` method is used to open a file named "input/json/file.json" in write mode ('w').  The block passed to `File.open` then uses `JSON.dump` to serialize the `hash` into a JSON string and write it directly to the opened file.  This effectively creates a file containing the JSON representation of the hash.
