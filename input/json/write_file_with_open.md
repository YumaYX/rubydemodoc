 This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to write a hash to a JSON file using the `JSON` module in Ruby. The code first creates a hash with one key-value pair, and then uses the `File.open` method to open a file named "input/json/file.json" for writing. It then passes the hash object to the `JSON.dump` method, which serializes the hash as JSON data and writes it to the file. The resulting file will contain the JSON representation of the hash object, which can be read back into a Ruby program using the `JSON` module's `load` method.
