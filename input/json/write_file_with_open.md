This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to serialize a Ruby hash to a JSON file. Specifically, it utilizes the `json` library to convert a hash named `hash` with a key named 'key' and the associated value 'value' into a JSON formatted string, and subsequently writes this JSON string to a file named `input/json/file.json` using the `JSON.dump` method. The `JSON.dump` method takes the hash as its first argument and the file object as its second argument, effectively saving the JSON representation of the hash to the specified file.
