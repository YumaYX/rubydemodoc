This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to write a Ruby hash to a JSON file. First, it requires the `json` library, which provides methods for working with JSON data. Then, it defines a hash with a single key-value pair, where the key is "key" and the value is "value". Next, it opens a file named "input/json/file.json" in write mode ("w").  A block is then passed to the `File.open` method, which specifies that the `JSON.dump` method should be called on the file object. `JSON.dump(hash, f)` converts the Ruby hash into a JSON string and writes it to the opened file.
