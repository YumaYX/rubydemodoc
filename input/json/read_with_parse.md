This Ruby code snippet demonstrates parsing a JSON file. The `require 'json'` statement loads the JSON library, which is essential for working with JSON data in Ruby. The `JSON.parse(File.read('input/json/file.json'))` line reads the entire content of the `file.json` file located in the `input/json` directory, and then uses the `JSON.parse` method to convert the JSON string into a Ruby object. This object can then be manipulated and used within the Ruby program.
