 This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read and parse JSON data from a file using the `JSON` module in Ruby. The `JSON.parse()` method is used to parse the JSON data, and the `File.read()` method is used to read the contents of the input file. The resulting object is then returned as a Hash.

Here's an example of how you could use this code:
```
file = File.open('input/json/file.json')
data = JSON.parse(file)
puts data # => {"name": "John Doe", "age": 30}
```
In this example, the `File.read()` method is used to read the contents of the input file, which contains a JSON object with two key-value pairs. The `JSON.parse()` method is then used to parse the JSON data and return it as a Hash. Finally, the resulting object is printed using the `puts` method.

Note that this code assumes that the input file exists and is located in the `input/json/` directory. You may need to modify the path to match your specific setup.
