This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read a JSON file and parse its content into a Ruby object. The code first requires the `json` library, which provides functions for working with JSON data. Then, it uses `File.read('input/json/file.json')` to read the entire content of the file located at the specified path.  The `JSON.parse()` method then takes the string content read from the file and attempts to convert it into a Ruby object, assuming the string is valid JSON. If the JSON is valid, the method returns the corresponding Ruby object (e.g., a hash, an array, a string, a number, or a boolean). If the JSON is invalid, it will raise a `JSON::ParserError` exception.
