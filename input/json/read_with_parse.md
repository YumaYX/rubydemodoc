This code snippet uses the `JSON` library in Ruby to parse a JSON file.

*   `require 'json'` : This line includes the `json` library, which provides functionality for working with JSON data.
*   `JSON.parse(File.read('input/json/file.json'))`: This line reads the content of the file named `file.json` located in the `input/json` directory. Then, it uses the `JSON.parse` method to convert the JSON string into a Ruby object (usually a hash or an array, depending on the JSON structure).
