This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read and parse a JSON file using the `JSON` class provided by the `json` gem. The code first requires the `json` gem, which provides the `JSON` class for parsing JSON data. Then it uses the `File.read` method to read the contents of a JSON file located at `input/json/file.json`. Finally, it calls the `parse` method on the `JSON` class to parse the JSON data and returns the parsed data in Ruby's hash format.
