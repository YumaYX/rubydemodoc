This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read a JSON file and parse its content into a Ruby object. The code first requires the `json` library, which provides functions for working with JSON data. Then, it uses `File.read('input/json/file.json')` to read the entire content of the file located at the specified path. Finally, it uses `JSON.parse()` to parse the JSON string read from the file into a Ruby object. The resulting Ruby object can then be accessed and manipulated as needed within the program. Note that if the file does not exist or contains invalid JSON, this code will raise an error.
