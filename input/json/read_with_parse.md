This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading a JSON file named 'file.json' located within the 'input/json' directory and parsing its contents into a Ruby data structure, most likely a hash or an array, depending on the structure of the JSON file. The `require 'json'` statement loads the JSON library, which provides the necessary functionality to work with JSON data.  The `JSON.parse` method then takes the contents of the file, read using `File.read('input/json/file.json')`, and transforms it into a Ruby data structure. This is a common technique for handling JSON data in Ruby applications.
