This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading a JSON file named 'file.json' located in the 'input/json' directory and then parsing the contents of that file into a Ruby data structure, most likely a hash or an array, depending on the structure of the JSON file. Specifically, the `require 'json'` line loads the `json` library, which provides methods for working with JSON data in Ruby. The `JSON.parse(File.read('input/json/file.json'))` line first reads the entire content of the specified JSON file using `File.read`, and then the `JSON.parse` method converts that string into a Ruby object. This is a common pattern for working with JSON data in Ruby applications where data is stored in a JSON format file.
