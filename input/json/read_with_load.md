This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read a JSON file and parse its content into a Ruby object. The code first requires the 'json' library, which provides functions for working with JSON data. Then, it uses `File.read('input/json/file.json')` to read the entire content of the file specified by the path 'input/json/file.json' as a string. Finally, it uses `JSON.load()` to parse the JSON string and convert it into a Ruby object. The resulting Ruby object can then be used to access and manipulate the data stored in the JSON file.
