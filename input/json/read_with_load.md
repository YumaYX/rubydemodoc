This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to load JSON data from a file using the `JSON` module in Ruby. The first line requires the `json` library, which is necessary for working with JSON data. The second line reads the contents of a JSON file and loads it into memory as a Ruby object using the `load()` method of the `JSON` module.

It's worth noting that this approach assumes that the JSON file is located in the current directory or a subdirectory called `input/json`. If the file is located elsewhere, you will need to specify the full path to the file instead.
