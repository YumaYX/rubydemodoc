 This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `JSON` library to load a JSON file and convert it into a Ruby object. The `require 'json'` line at the beginning of the script imports the `JSON` module, which provides functions for parsing and generating JSON data in Ruby. The `File.read('input/json/file.json')` method reads the contents of a JSON file located in the `input/json` directory and returns a string containing the file's contents. The `JSON.load()` method then takes this string as input and parses it into a Ruby object, which is returned by the method.

To use this code snippet, you will need to replace `'input/json/file.json'` with the path to your JSON file on your computer. You can also modify the code to read from other sources, such as a string or an HTTP response.
