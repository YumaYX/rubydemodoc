This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read a JSON file and parse its contents into a Ruby data structure. Specifically, the `require 'json'` line loads the `json` library, which provides functions for working with JSON data. The `JSON.load(File.read('input/json/file.json'))` line reads the entire contents of the file located at `input/json/file.json`, assumes itâ€™s a JSON string, and then uses the `JSON.load` function to convert that string into a Ruby object, typically a hash or an array, depending on the structure of the JSON data within the file.  This allows you to work with the JSON data directly within your Ruby program.
