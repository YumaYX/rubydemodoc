This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the loading of a JSON file into a Ruby data structure. Specifically, it uses the `JSON` library to parse the contents of the file named `input/json/file.json`, which is assumed to be in JSON format. The `JSON.load` method is utilized to convert the JSON string from the file into a Ruby object, which is then stored in a variable (not specified in the provided context, but typically a hash or array depending on the file's structure). This process allows the Ruby code to work with the data directly within the script.
