This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading a JSON file and parsing its contents. It first `require`s the `json` library, enabling JSON processing. Then, `File.read('input/json/file.json')` reads the entire content of the file 'file.json' located in the 'input/json' directory. Finally, `JSON.load()` parses this content as JSON and returns a Ruby hash (in this example, `{"key" => "value"}`).
