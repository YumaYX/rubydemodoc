This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read and parse a JSON file. Specifically, the `require 'json'` line loads the `json` library, which provides functionality for working with JSON data in Ruby. The `JSON.load(File.read('input/json/file.json'))` line then reads the entire contents of the file named `file.json` located within the `input/json/` directory. Finally, the `JSON.load` method parses the string read from the file, converting it into a Ruby data structure (typically a hash or an array, depending on the structure of the JSON data).  The resulting parsed data is then available for further manipulation within the Ruby program.
