This code snippet uses the Ruby `JSON` library to load data from a JSON file named "file.json" located in the "input/json" directory.  It reads the entire content of the JSON file, parses it into a Ruby object (typically a hash or array), and then makes the parsed data available for further use in the Ruby program.
