This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the creation of a JSON file. The `require 'json'` statement loads the JSON library, which is essential for working with JSON data in Ruby. A hash named `hash` is initialized with a single key-value pair: `key` set to `value`.  Next, `File.write('input/json/file.json', JSON.dump(hash))` is executed. This line utilizes the `File.write` method to create or overwrite a file named `file.json` located within the `input/json/` directory. The `JSON.dump(hash)` method converts the Ruby hash `hash` into a JSON string, and this string is then written to the specified file. Consequently, a JSON file containing the key-value pair would be generated in the specified location.
