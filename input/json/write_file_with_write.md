 This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to write a hash to a file in JSON format using the `JSON` module in Ruby.

The first line, `require 'json'`, loads the JSON library into the current script, allowing us to use its functions for working with JSON data.

Next, we define a hash object `hash` with one key-value pair. The key is `:key` and the value is `'value'`.

Then, we use the `File.write()` method to write the contents of the `hash` object to a file named `input/json/file.json`. We use the `JSON.dump()` method to convert the hash object to JSON format before writing it to the file.

Note that the path to the output file is specified as `'input/json/file.json'`, and the method uses the current working directory of the script as the base path for the file name. If you want to specify a different base path or use an absolute path, you can modify the path accordingly.
