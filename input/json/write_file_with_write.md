This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to write a Ruby hash to a JSON file. It first requires the `json` library. Then, it defines a hash with a key-value pair.  Next, it uses `JSON.dump` to convert the hash into a JSON string and writes this string to a file named "file.json" located in the "input/json" directory. The `File.write` method returns the number of bytes written to the file.
