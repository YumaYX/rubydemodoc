This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to work with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) in Ruby. First, it requires the `json` library, which provides methods for encoding and decoding JSON data. Then, it creates a Ruby hash with a key-value pair: the key is "key" and the value is "value". Next, it uses the `File.write` method to write the JSON representation of this hash to a file named "input/json/file.json". The `JSON.dump(hash)` method converts the Ruby hash into a JSON string, and this string is then written to the specified file.  Essentially, this code creates a JSON file containing a simple key-value pair.
