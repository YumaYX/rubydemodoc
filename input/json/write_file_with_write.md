This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to create a JSON file from a Ruby hash. First, the `require 'json'` statement loads the JSON library, which is essential for working with JSON data in Ruby. Then, a hash named `hash` is initialized with a single key-value pair: `key` is set to 'value'. Finally, the `File.write` method is used to write the JSON representation of this hash to a file named 'input/json/file.json'. The `JSON.dump` method converts the Ruby hash into a JSON string, and `File.write` then writes this string to the specified file, creating or overwriting 'input/json/file.json' with the JSON data.
