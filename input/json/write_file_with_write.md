This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to write a Ruby hash to a JSON file. First, it requires the `json` library, which provides methods for working with JSON data. Then, it defines a hash with a single key-value pair: the key is "key" and the value is "value". Next, it uses the `File.write` method to write the JSON representation of this hash to a file named "input/json/file.json". The `JSON.dump` method converts the Ruby hash into a JSON string, which is then written to the specified file.
