This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to fetch data from a JSON API using the `net/http` and `json` libraries. First, it requires the `net/http` and `json` libraries. Then, it defines a URL to the OpenBD API to retrieve information about a book with the ISBN 9784791765553.  The URL is parsed into a URI object. Next, it uses `Net::HTTP.get` to send a GET request to the specified URL and retrieves the response as a string. Finally, it uses `JSON.parse` to parse the JSON response string into a Ruby hash or array, which is then stored in the `rresponse` variable. In essence, the code fetches data from a specified URL, assuming the data is in JSON format, and parses it into a usable data structure.
