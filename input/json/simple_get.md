This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to use the `Net::HTTP` module in Ruby to make an HTTP request and parse the JSON response using the `JSON` library.

Here's a breakdown of each line of code:

* `require "net/http"` loads the `Net::HTTP` module, which allows you to make HTTP requests in Ruby.
* `require "json"` loads the `JSON` library, which provides functions for parsing and generating JSON data.
* `url = "https://api.openbd.jp/v1/get?isbn=9784791765553"` defines the URL to make an HTTP request to. In this case, it's a URL that retrieves information about a book with ISBN number 9784791765553.
* `uri = URI(url)` creates a new `URI` object from the specified URL.
* `response = Net::HTTP.get(uri)` makes an HTTP GET request to the specified URL and stores the response in the `response` variable.
* `JSON.parse(response)` parses the JSON data in the `response` variable using the `JSON.parse()` function, which returns a Ruby hash containing the parsed JSON data.

This code snippet can be used to retrieve information about a book from an API and parse it as JSON data in Ruby.
