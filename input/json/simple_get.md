This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to retrieve and parse JSON data from a RESTful API using the `Net::HTTP` class in Ruby. The first line requires the `net/http` library, which is used for making HTTP requests. The second line requires the `json` library, which is used for parsing JSON data.

The code then defines the URL of the RESTful API and creates a URI object from it using the `URI(url)` method. The next line retrieves the response from the API using the `Net::HTTP.get(uri)` method, which sends an HTTP GET request to the API and returns the response as a string.

Finally, the code parses the JSON data in the response using the `JSON.parse(response)` method, which converts the JSON data into a Ruby hash object that can be easily manipulated within the program.

Note: The `require` statements at the beginning of the code are used to include libraries that are needed for making HTTP requests and parsing JSON data in Ruby.
