This Ruby code snippet demonstrates fetching data from a REST API using the `net/http` and `json` libraries. Specifically, it retrieves information about a book identified by its ISBN (International Standard Book Number) – in this case, ISBN 9784791765553 – from the OpenBD Japanese database API. The code first requires the necessary libraries. Then, it defines the URL of the API endpoint. It creates a `URI` object from the URL. Subsequently, it uses `Net::HTTP.get` to send a GET request to the URL and retrieves the response from the server. Finally, it parses the response, assuming it is in JSON format, using `JSON.parse` to convert it into a Ruby data structure (likely a hash or array) for further processing.
