This Ruby code snippet demonstrates fetching data from a JSON API endpoint and parsing the response. It utilizes the `net/http` library to make an HTTP GET request to the provided URL, which is "https://api.openbd.jp/v1/get?isbn=9784791765553". The retrieved response, which is assumed to be a JSON string, is then parsed using the `JSON.parse` method, transforming it into a Ruby data structure for further processing.
