This Ruby code snippet demonstrates a program that fetches book data from the OpenBD API using the ISBN 9784791765553. First, the `net/http` and `json` libraries are required to facilitate network communication and JSON parsing, respectively.  A URL pointing to the OpenBD API endpoint with the specified ISBN is defined. The `Net::HTTP.get` method then uses this URL to retrieve the raw response from the API. Finally, the `JSON.parse` method takes this response (which is assumed to be a JSON string) and converts it into a Ruby hash or array object, allowing further processing of the retrieved book data.
