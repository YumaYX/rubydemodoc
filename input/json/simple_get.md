This code uses Ruby to fetch data from the OpenBD API based on an ISBN. 

Here's a breakdown:

*   `require "net/http"`:  Includes the `net/http` library, which allows the code to make HTTP requests.
*   `require "json"`: Includes the `json` library, enabling the code to parse JSON responses.
*   `url = "https://api.openbd.jp/v1/get?isbn=9784791765553"`: Defines the URL of the OpenBD API, with the ISBN "9784791765553" as a parameter.
*   `uri = URI(url)`: Creates a `URI` object from the URL string. This is necessary for the `Net::HTTP` library.
*   `response = Net::HTTP.get(uri)`: Sends an HTTP GET request to the URI and retrieves the response body as a string.
*   `JSON.parse(response)`: Parses the response string (which is expected to be JSON) into a Ruby object (usually a hash or an array) for further processing.
