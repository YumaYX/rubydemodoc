This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to fetch data from an API that returns JSON-formatted data using the `net/http` and `json` gems. The code first requires both gems, then it defines a URL variable with the endpoint of the API, creates a URI object from the URL, sends an HTTP GET request to the API using the `Net::HTTP.get()` method, and finally parses the JSON response using the `JSON.parse()` method. The resulting hash can then be used for further processing or storage.
