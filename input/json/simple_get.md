This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to fetch data from a JSON API and parse the response. First, it requires the `net/http` and `json` libraries, which are necessary for making HTTP requests and parsing JSON data, respectively. Then, it defines a URL to the OpenBD API using a specific ISBN.  The URL is converted into a URI object.  Next, it uses `Net::HTTP.get` to send a GET request to the specified URL and retrieves the response. Finally, it uses `JSON.parse` to parse the JSON response string into a Ruby hash or array, which can then be accessed and used in the program.
