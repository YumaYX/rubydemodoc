This Ruby code snippet demonstrates loading data from a JSON file named “file.json” located in the “input/json” directory. The `require 'json'` statement loads the JSON library, which provides functionality for working with JSON data.  `File.open('input/json/file.json') {|j| JSON.load(j)}` opens the specified file for reading, assigns the file object to the variable `j`, and then uses `JSON.load(j)` to parse the contents of the file as a Ruby data structure, typically a hash or an array, based on the format of the JSON file.  The parsed data is then available for use in the rest of the Ruby program.
