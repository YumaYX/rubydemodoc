 This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read a JSON file using the `JSON` library in Ruby. The code first opens the JSON file using the `File.open()` method, which takes the path to the file as an argument. The block passed to `File.open()` is executed for each line in the file, and in this case, it reads the contents of the file into a string variable called `j`.

The `JSON.load()` method is then called on the string `j`, which parses the JSON data contained in the string and returns a Ruby object that represents the data in the file. The returned object can be manipulated using Ruby methods, such as `each` to iterate over the data or `select` to filter out specific elements.

For example, if the JSON file contains an array of objects representing people, the code could use the `select()` method to find all the people who are aged between 20 and 30, like this:
```
require 'json'
File.open('input/json/file.json') {|j| JSON.load(j).select {|person| person['age'] >= 20 && person['age'] <= 30}}
```
This code would return an array of objects representing all the people who are between 20 and 30 years old, as specified by the `select` block.
