This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read a JSON file and parse its contents into a Ruby data structure. The `require 'json'` line loads the JSON library, which provides methods for working with JSON data. The `File.open('input/json/file.json') {|j| JSON.load(j)}` line opens the file named "file.json" located in the "input/json" directory. The `File.open` method takes a block of code that will be executed for each line of the file. Inside the block, `JSON.load(j)` parses the JSON data from the file object `j` and converts it into a Ruby data structure, most commonly a hash or an array, depending on the structure of the JSON file. The resulting Ruby data structure is then available for further processing within the Ruby program.
