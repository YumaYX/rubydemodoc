This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading and parsing a JSON file. It first requires the `json` library. Then, it opens a file named 'file.json' located in the 'input/json/' directory, reads its contents, and parses it as JSON using `JSON.load`, resulting in a Ruby hash (in this case, `{"key" => "value"}`).
