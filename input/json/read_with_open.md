This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to load a JSON file into a Ruby object. Specifically, it utilizes the `JSON` library to parse the contents of a JSON file named `input/json/file.json` and store the resulting data as a Ruby object. The `JSON.load(j)` function reads the file content (`j`) and converts it into a Ruby data structure, typically a hash or array, based on the JSON format of the file.
