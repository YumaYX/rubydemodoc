This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read and parse a JSON file in Ruby. First, it requires the `json` library, which provides functions for working with JSON data. Then, it opens a file named "file.json" located in the "input/json" directory. The `|j|` part is a block that passes the opened file object to the `JSON.load` method. `JSON.load(j)` reads the JSON data from the file object `j` and parses it into a Ruby object (typically a hash or an array). The parsed JSON data is then assigned to a variable, which is not explicitly shown in the snippet but would be used later in the program to access and manipulate the data.
