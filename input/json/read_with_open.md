This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read a JSON file and parse its contents into a Ruby object. First, the code requires the 'json' library, which provides functions for working with JSON data. Then, it opens a file named "file.json" located in the "input/json" directory. The `|j|` part is a block that represents the file object opened by `File.open`. Inside the block, `JSON.load(j)` reads the JSON data from the file object `j` and parses it into a Ruby object. This Ruby object is then implicitly assigned to the variable `j`, which can be used to access and manipulate the JSON data.
