This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to capture multi-line strings into a variable. It uses the `<<~` operator to create the `text` variable, containing three lines.  Then, the `lines` variable is created by splitting `text` into an array of lines, removing trailing newlines (`chomp`) from each line.
