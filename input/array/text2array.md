This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to split a multi-line string into an array of individual lines.  Specifically, the `text` variable is initialized with a multi-line string containing the characters "a", "b", and "c" separated by newline characters. The `text.lines` method iterates through the string, treating each newline character as a line separator.  The `map(&:chomp)` method then applies the `chomp` method to each line, which removes the trailing newline character. Finally, the resulting array of strings, where each element is a single line from the original multi-line string, is stored in the `lines` variable.
