This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read a multiline string into an array of strings, where each string represents a line from the original multiline string, and also shows how to remove trailing whitespace from each line. The code first defines a multiline string `text` containing three lines: "a", "b", and "c". Then, the `lines` variable is assigned the result of calling the `lines` method on `text`. The `lines` method returns an array of strings, where each string is the content of one line, and the `chomp` method is used to remove any trailing newline characters from each string before adding it to the array.
