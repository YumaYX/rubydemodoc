This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to split a multi-line string into an array of strings, removing trailing newline characters from each line. Specifically, it uses `text.lines` to iterate through the lines of the `text` string, `map(&:chomp)` to call the `chomp` method on each line (which removes the trailing newline), and stores the result in the `lines` variable.
