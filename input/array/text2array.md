This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to split a string into lines and remove the new line characters from each line. The `<<~` operator is used to create a heredoc, which allows us to define a multi-line string as if it were a variable. We then use the `lines` method to get an array of strings, where each string represents a single line in the original string. Finally, we use the `map` method with the `&:chomp` block to remove the new line characters from each string in the array.

Note: The `<<~` operator is used to create a heredoc, which allows us to define a multi-line string as if it were a variable. This is useful for defining long strings that are not suitable for single lines.
