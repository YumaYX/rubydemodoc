This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read a multi-line string and process it into an array of strings, removing trailing newline characters. First, a string variable named `text` is assigned a multi-line string using a heredoc. Then, the `lines` variable is assigned the result of processing the `text` string. The `text.lines` method splits the string into an array of individual lines. The `map(&:chomp)` method then iterates through each line in the array and applies the `chomp` method to it. The `chomp` method removes any trailing newline characters from each line.  The resulting array of strings, where each string represents a line from the original multi-line string with the newline characters removed, is stored in the `lines` variable.
