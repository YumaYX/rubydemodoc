This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to split a string into individual lines and remove the newline characters using the `String#lines` method, which returns an array of strings where each element represents a line in the original string. The `.map(&:chomp)` method is then used to iterate over the array of strings and apply the `String#chomp` method to each element, which removes any trailing newline characters from the end of the string.

The resulting array of strings can be accessed using the `lines` variable. For example, you could print out all the lines in the original string by iterating over the `lines` array and printing each element.
