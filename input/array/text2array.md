This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to split a multi-line string into an array of individual lines. The `text` variable is initialized with a multi-line string containing the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' separated by newline characters. The `text.lines` method returns an iterator that yields each line of the string. The `map(&:chomp)` method then applies the `chomp` method to each line, which removes any trailing whitespace (including newline characters) from the end of each line, and returns a new array containing these processed lines.  Essentially, it creates an array where each element is a string representing a single line from the original multi-line string.
