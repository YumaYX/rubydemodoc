This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read a multi-line string and process it. 

First, a heredoc string containing three lines ("a", "b", "c") is assigned to the variable `text`. 

Then, the `lines` variable is created by splitting the `text` string into an array of individual lines using the `lines` method. The `chomp` method is then applied to each line to remove any trailing newline characters.  The resulting `lines` array contains the strings "a", "b", and "c".
