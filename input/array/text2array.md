This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to process a multi-line string in Ruby. The code first defines a string variable named `text` using a heredoc, which allows for a multi-line string definition. Then, it splits the `text` string into individual lines using the `lines` method. Finally, it uses the `map` method to iterate over each line and apply the `chomp` method to remove any trailing newline characters. The result is stored in a new array called `lines`, where each element is a line from the original string with the newline characters removed.
