 This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to convert a string into an array of lines in Ruby. The `<<~TEXT` syntax is used to indicate that the following indented block should be treated as a here document, and the `text` variable is assigned to the indented text block.

The first line of the code defines a variable called `lines`, which is set to the result of calling the `lines` method on the string `text`. The `lines` method returns an array of lines in the string, each of which is represented as a separate element in the array. The `&:chomp` symbol is used to indicate that the `chomp` method should be called on each line before it is added to the array.

The resulting array `lines` contains three elements, each representing one line of the original text string.
