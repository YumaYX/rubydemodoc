This Ruby code snippet demonstrates set intersection and finding common elements between arrays. Specifically, `(a & b).sort.first` calculates the intersection of arrays `a` and `b`, sorts the resulting set, and returns the first element.  `a.find { |x| b.include?(x) }` finds the first element present in both arrays `a` and `b`.
