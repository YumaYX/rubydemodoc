This Ruby code snippet demonstrates finding common elements between two arrays (`a` and `b`). It first uses the `&` operator (intersection) to find the common elements, sorts them, and retrieves the first element.  Then, it uses `find` with `include?` to find the first element in `a` that also exists in `b`, achieving the same result. Both methods return "l9ma" in this case.
