This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the creation of arrays from strings and symbols, using different delimiters and interpolation techniques. Specifically, `%w`, `%W`, `%i`, and `%I` are used to generate arrays containing strings and symbols, respectively, potentially with embedded string interpolation using `#{}` or `\"` escaping.
