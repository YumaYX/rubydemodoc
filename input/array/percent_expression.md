This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the creation of arrays from strings and symbols. Specifically, it shows how `%w`, `%W`, `%i`, and `%I` operators construct arrays containing strings, words, integers, and symbols, respectively, with string interpolation included when using the `%W` and `%I` operators.
