This Ruby code snippet demonstrates string and symbol array creation using different shortcuts. 

*   `%w()` creates an array of strings by splitting the input string at whitespace. String interpolation (`#{str}`) is not evaluated within `%w`.
*   `%W()` is similar to `%w()`, but *does* evaluate string interpolation, creating an array of strings.
*   `%i()` creates an array of symbols. String interpolation is treated literally.
*   `%I()` creates an array of symbols and *does* evaluate string interpolation, creating symbols from the evaluated strings.
