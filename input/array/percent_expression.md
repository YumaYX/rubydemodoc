This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of interpolation in arrays. The `%w` and `%W` methods create an array of strings, with each element separated by a space. The `%i` and `%I` methods create an array of symbols, with each element separated by a space. The difference between `%w` and `%W` is that `%W` uses double quotes while `%w` uses single quotes to delimit the elements. Similarly, `%i` and `%I` use single quotes or double quotes to delimit the elements, respectively.

The code snippet also shows how interpolation can be used in arrays to create dynamic values. The `#{str}` expression is interpolated into the array, resulting in a different value for each element depending on the value of `str`.
