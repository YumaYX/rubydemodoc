This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of interpolation in arrays and hashes. In Ruby, you can include variables inside a string by using the `#{}` notation. For example, if we have a variable `str = "ruby"`, then we can create an array with the elements "a", "b", "c", and "ruby" like this:
```
%w(a b c "#{str}")
=> ["a", "b", "c", "ruby"]
```
This creates an array with four elements, where the third element is the value of the variable `str`.

Similarly, we can create a hash with the keys "a", "b", and "c" and the value of the variable `str` like this:
```
%i(a b c "#{str}")
=> {:a=>1, :b=>2, :c=>3, str=>"ruby"}
```
This creates a hash with four key-value pairs, where the third key is the value of the variable `str`. Note that the keys in this case are symbols, not strings.
