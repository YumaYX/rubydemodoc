This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `%w()` and `%W()` methods to create an array of words. The difference between these two methods is that `%w()` returns a word array that is mutable, while `%W()` returns a word array that is immutable.

The `%i()` and `%I()` methods are similar to `%w()` and `%W()`, but they return an array of symbols instead of strings.

Note: The `#{str}` syntax is used for string interpolation, which allows you to insert the value of `str` into a string literal. In this case, it inserts the word "ruby" into each element of the array.
