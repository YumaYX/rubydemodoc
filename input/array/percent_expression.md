This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of different string literals and their variations in Ruby. 

The code first defines a string variable named `str` and assigns it the value "ruby". 

Then, it showcases four different ways to create arrays of string literals using the `%` operator: `%w`, `%W`, `%i`, and `%I`. 

- `%w(a b c "#{str}")` creates an array of string literals "a", "b", "c", and the value of the `str` variable, which is "ruby".
- `%W(a b c "#{str}")` creates a string containing the string literals "a", "b", "c", and the value of the `str` variable, "ruby". This is a string interpolation method.
- `%i(a b c "#{str}")` creates an array of string literals "a", "b", "c", and the value of the `str` variable, "ruby". This is similar to `%w`, but it automatically converts the string literals to symbols.
- `%I(a b c "#{str}")` creates a string containing the string literals "a", "b", "c", and the value of the `str` variable, "ruby". This is similar to `%W`, but it treats the string literals as symbols.

In essence, the code illustrates how to create arrays and strings containing string literals in Ruby, highlighting the differences between string and symbol representations.
