This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the different ways to create arrays of strings using the `%` and `%I` operators, highlighting variations in how they handle quotes and special characters. The `%` operator, when used with strings, treats them as literal strings, including the quotes within the string, resulting in an array containing the literal string `"ruby"` and the string `"ruby"`. Similarly, `%W` also treats the string as literal, and includes the string `"ruby"` and the string `"ruby"`. The `%i` operator, when used with strings, creates an array of integers. The `%I` operator, when used with strings, creates an array of integers.
