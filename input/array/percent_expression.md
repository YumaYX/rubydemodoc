This Ruby code snippet demonstrates string interpolation and different ways to create arrays of strings. It shows that:

- `%w` (word array) and `%W` (string array) create arrays of strings.  `%W` automatically interpolates variables within the string.
- `%i` (identifier array) creates an array of symbols.  It also interpolates variables within the string.
- The code uses string interpolation (`#{str}`) to embed the value of the `str` variable ("ruby") within the created arrays. The difference between `%w` and `%W` is that `%W` automatically converts the interpolated string to a string, while `%w` leaves it as a string literal.
