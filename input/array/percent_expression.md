This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the differences between the `%w`, `%W`, `%i`, and `%I` array literal operators. The `%w` and `%W` operators are used to create arrays from strings, where each string in the argument list becomes an element in the resulting array. The `%w` operator uses double quotes for string delimiters, while `%W` uses single quotes.  The `%i` and `%I` operators similarly create arrays from integers, with `%i` using double quotes for string delimiters and `%I` using single quotes. Essentially, these operators provide a concise and convenient way to initialize arrays with specific values, but they differ in the string delimiters they accept.
