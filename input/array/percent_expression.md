This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `%w` and `%W` literals to create an array of strings in Ruby. The difference between these two literals is that `%w` creates an array of strings using single quotes, while `%W` creates an array of strings using double quotes.

The `%i` and `%I` literals are similar, but they create arrays of symbols instead of strings. Symbols are unique objects in Ruby that can be used to identify a specific object in the program.

Note: The `#{}` syntax is called interpolation and it allows you to insert dynamic values into a string literal. In this case, the variable `str` is interpolated into the string literal using the `#{}` syntax.
