This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of different string interpolation methods in Ruby. 

The code defines a string variable `str` with the value "ruby". It then uses several string interpolation operators: `%w`, `%W`, `%i`, and `%I`. 

- `%w(a b c #{str})` uses word-list interpolation, which treats the content within the parentheses as a list of words. It substitutes the value of the `str` variable ("ruby") into the string.
- `%W(a b c #{str})` uses string interpolation, which allows for more complex expressions and formatting. It also substitutes the value of the `str` variable.
- `%i(a b c #{str})` uses identifier interpolation, which treats the content within the parentheses as a list of identifiers (variable names). It substitutes the value of the `str` variable.
- `%I(a b c #{str})` uses heredoc interpolation, which allows for multi-line strings and variable interpolation. It substitutes the value of the `str` variable.

In essence, all these operators achieve the same outcome in this specific example, which is to create a string containing the words "a", "b", "c", and "ruby". The choice of which operator to use often depends on the complexity of the string being constructed and the desired formatting.
