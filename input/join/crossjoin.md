 This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `product` method in combination with other methods to create a collection of all possible combinations of elements from three arrays. The `product` method takes multiple arrays as arguments and returns a new array that contains all possible combinations of elements from the input arrays.

The first line of code, `a = ('a'..'c').to_a`, creates an array containing the letters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The second line, `b = 2.times.to_a`, creates an array containing two elements, 0 and 1. The third line, `c = [{}]`, creates an empty hash.

The final line of code, `a.product(b, c)`, uses the `product` method to create a new array that contains all possible combinations of elements from `a`, `b`, and `c`. This will result in a new array with 6 elements, each consisting of a combination of an element from `a`, `b`, and `c`.

For example, if the input arrays are `['a', 'b', 'c']`, `[0, 1]`, and `{}`, then the output array would contain the following combinations:
```
[['a', 0, {}], ['a', 1, {}], ['b', 0, {}], ['b', 1, {}], ['c', 0, {}], ['c', 1, {}]]
```
Note that the output array will contain a combination of each element from `a`, `b`, and `c`, in all possible orders.
