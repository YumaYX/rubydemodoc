This Ruby code snippet demonstrates nested `product` method usage. It generates all possible combinations of elements from arrays `a`, `b`, and `c`.  `a` contains characters 'a', 'b', and 'c', `b` contains integers 0 and 1, and `c` contains a single empty hash. The `product` method effectively creates a new array containing all possible tuples formed by taking one element from each of these arrays.
