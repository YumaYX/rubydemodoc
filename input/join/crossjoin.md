This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of array creation, the `to_a` method, the `times` method, and the `product` method. First, it creates an array `a` containing the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' using the range operator and `to_a`. Then, it creates an array `b` containing two elements, each being the number 2, also using `to_a` and the `times` method. Next, it creates an array `c` containing an array with an empty hash. Finally, it uses the `product` method to generate all possible combinations of elements from arrays `a`, `b`, and `c`. The result is an array of arrays, where each inner array contains one element from `a`, one element from `b`, and one element from `c`.

Specifically, the `product` method calculates the Cartesian product of the input arrays. In this case, it produces an array of arrays, with each inner array containing a combination of elements from `a`, `b`, and `c`. The output will be:

```
[
  ["a", 2, {}],
  ["a", 2, {}],
  ["a", 2, {}],
  ["a", 2, {}],
  ["b", 2, {}],
  ["b", 2, {}],
  ["b", 2, {}],
  ["c", 2, {}]
]
```
