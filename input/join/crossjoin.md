*   `a`: Creates an array of characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
*   `b`: Creates an array of numbers 0, 1, and 2.
*   `c`: Creates an array containing a single empty hash.
*   `a.product(b, c)`:  This is a Cartesian product. It generates all possible combinations of elements from `a`, `b`, and `c`.  The result is an array of hashes, where each hash contains one element from `a`, one element from `b`, and one element from `c`.
