This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to combine user and post information based on a user's ID. The code initializes two arrays, `users` and `posts`, each containing a list of hash objects. The `users` array holds information about users with their `id` and `name`, while the `posts` array stores post details including a `user_id` and `title`. The code then uses the `map` method to iterate through each user in the `users` array. Within the `map` block, for each `user`, it searches the `posts` array to find a corresponding post where the `user_id` matches the current user's `id`. The `find` method returns the matching post if found, or `nil` if no post is associated with that user. Finally, the `merge` method is used to combine the user hash with the post hash (or a hash with `title: nil` if no post is found), creating a new hash containing user information and post details, or the user's information with a `title` of `nil` if no post exists.
