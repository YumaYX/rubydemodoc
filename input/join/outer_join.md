This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to combine user and post data, resulting in a new array of user objects enriched with post information. Specifically, it iterates through a list of user objects, and for each user, it searches the `posts` array for a matching post based on the user's `id`. If a matching post is found, the user object is merged with the post details (including `title`). If no matching post is found, the `title` attribute is set to `nil`. The final result is a new array of user objects, each containing the original user data along with associated post data if available; otherwise, the `title` will be `nil`.
