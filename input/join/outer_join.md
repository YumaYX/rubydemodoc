This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to combine data from two arrays, `users` and `posts`, to create a new array containing user information along with their associated posts.  The code iterates through each user in the `users` array and attempts to find a corresponding post based on the user's ID.  If a matching post is found, the user's hash is merged with the post's data, including the post's title. If no matching post is found, the `title` field is set to `nil` in the resulting user hash.  The resulting array contains user objects with their names and any associated posts, providing a combined representation of user and post data.
