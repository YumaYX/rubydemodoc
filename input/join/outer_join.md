This Ruby code snippet demonstrates retrieving posts associated with users and merging them into a user array. It maps over the `users` array, finds the corresponding post for each user based on `user_id`, and then merges the post data (if found) into the user's hash, adding a `title` key with the post's title or `nil` if no post is found.
