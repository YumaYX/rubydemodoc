This Ruby code snippet retrieves user data and their associated posts, merging them into a new array of user objects with post information. It maps over the `users` array, finds the corresponding post for each user based on `user_id`, and merges the post data (if found) into the user object. If a post isn't found, the `title` field is set to `nil`.
