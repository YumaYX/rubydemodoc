This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to enrich an array of user hashes with associated post data. It iterates through the `users` array and attempts to find a corresponding `post` based on `user_id`.  If a post is found, it's merged into the user hash; otherwise, a `title: nil` is added to the user hash. The result is a new array of user hashes, each potentially including a `title` from a related post or `nil` if no post exists for that user.
