This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to associate posts with users. It starts with a list of users and a list of posts. It then iterates through each user, finds the corresponding posts using the `user_id`, and merges the post data into the user object. If a user has no posts, a `title` of `nil` is added to the user object. The result is a list of users, each now containing their associated posts.
