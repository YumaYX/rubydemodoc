This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of `module_eval` to define a method inside a class that calls an old version of itself. The `deprecate` method takes the name of a method as its argument and defines an alias for the old method with a prefix of "deprecated_" (e.g., if the method is named "mymethod", the new method will be defined as "deprecated_mymethod"), then it calls the new method from inside the original method, passing in all arguments passed to the original method and any block that was given. This way you can deprecate a method by calling `deprecate :method_name` on your class.
