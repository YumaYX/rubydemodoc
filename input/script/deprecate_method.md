This Ruby code snippet demonstrates a mechanism to issue warnings when a method is called, indicating it's deprecated. It defines a `deprecate` method within the `Module` class that automatically creates a `deprecated_` alias and adds a warning message to the original method's implementation.  This is then used on `MyClass`'s `mymethod`, triggering the warning when `mymethod` is called.
