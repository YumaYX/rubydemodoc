This Ruby code snippet demonstrates a conditional execution block that is triggered only when the Ruby script is executed directly, rather than when it is required as a module. The `if __FILE__ == sh` condition checks if the current file is being executed as the main program. If this condition is true, the code within the block is executed. This is a common pattern in Ruby to separate code that should be run only when the script is executed directly from code that should be available when the script is required as a library. The code within the `if` block is intended to contain the main logic of the script.
