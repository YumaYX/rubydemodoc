This Ruby code snippet demonstrates a common pattern used to ensure that certain code within a Ruby script is only executed when the script is run directly, and not when it's included as a module or library in another script. Specifically, the `if __FILE__ == $0` condition checks if the current file being executed is the main script. The variable `$0` represents the name of the script being executed, and `__FILE__` is a special Ruby variable that contains the path of the current file.  If the script is run directly (meaning it's the top-level script being executed), the condition evaluates to `true`, and the code block indented below it is executed. However, if the script is included as a module or library in another script, `__FILE__` will have a different value, and the code block will not be executed, preventing unintended behavior.
