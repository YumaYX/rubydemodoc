This Ruby code snippet demonstrates a common idiom to ensure a block of code only runs when the Ruby file is executed directly (as a script), and *not* when it's `require`d as a library in another file. `__FILE__` holds the path to the current file, and `$0` holds the name of the script being executed. The `if` condition checks if these are equal, meaning the file is the main program being run.  The `=> nil` indicates the script doesn't explicitly return a value; implicitly it returns `nil`.
