This Ruby code snippet demonstrates a standard Ruby script structure. The `if __FILE__ == $0` block ensures that the code within it is executed only when the script is run directly, and not when it is required as a library by another script. This is a common practice in Ruby to separate executable code from code that is intended to be used as a module. The code block is currently empty, indicating that the script does not have any main logic to execute when run directly.
