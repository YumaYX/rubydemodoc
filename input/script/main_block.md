This Ruby code snippet demonstrates a common idiom for ensuring that a block of code is executed only when the Ruby script is run directly, and not when it's required as a library or included in another script. The `if __FILE__ == $0` statement checks if the current file is the main program being executed.  `__FILE__` is a special Ruby variable that holds the path to the current file. `$0` is another special Ruby variable that holds the path to the script being executed. When the script is run directly, `$0` will equal the path to the script file, and therefore `__FILE__ == $0` evaluates to `true`.  This allows developers to place code specifically designed for the standalone execution of the script within this conditional block, preventing it from being unintentionally executed when the script is used as a module or part of a larger project.
