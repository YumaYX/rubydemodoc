This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading data from a CSV file and converting it into an array of hashes. Specifically, the code utilizes the `CSV` library to read the CSV file located at `'input/csv/file.csv'`. The `encoding: "BOM\|UTF-8"` argument indicates that the file is encoded with Byte Order Mark (BOM) followed by UTF-8, ensuring correct handling of characters. The `headers: true` option tells the `CSV` library to use the first row of the CSV file as the headers for the data. Finally, the `.map(&:to_h)` method iterates through each row of the CSV data (which is now represented as an array of strings) and converts each row into a hash using the headers as keys.  This results in an array where each element is a hash representing a row from the CSV file.
