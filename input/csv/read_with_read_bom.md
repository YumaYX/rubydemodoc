 This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading a CSV file with the `CSV` module and converting it to an array of hashes, where each element in the array is a hash representing one row in the CSV file. The `headers` option is set to `true`, which means that the first row of the CSV file will be treated as headers and used as keys for the hashes. The `encoding` option is set to `"BOM|UTF-8"`, which specifies that the encoding of the CSV file should be UTF-8 with a byte order mark (BOM) at the beginning.
