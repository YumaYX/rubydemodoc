This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading a CSV file, converting each row to a hash, and then mapping the resulting hashes. The `require 'csv'` line imports the CSV library.  The `CSV.read('input/csv/file.csv', encoding: "BOM|UTF-8", headers: true)` part reads the CSV file located at 'input/csv/file.csv'. It specifies the encoding as "BOM|UTF-8", which handles Byte Order Mark and UTF-8 encoding. The `headers: true` option indicates that the first row of the CSV file contains the headers, which will be used as keys in the resulting hashes. The `.map(&:to_h)` part then iterates over each row (which is a CSV row object) and converts it into a hash.  Finally, the `map` method transforms the array of hashes into a new array containing these hashes.
