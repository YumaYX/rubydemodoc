This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading a CSV file with a Byte Order Mark (BOM) and UTF-8 encoding, treating the first row as headers, and then converting each row into a hash. The `CSV.read` method is utilized to read the CSV file, specifying the `encoding` as "BOM|UTF-8" to handle the BOM correctly. The `headers: true` option instructs the parser to interpret the first row as column headers. Finally, `.map(&:to_h)` transforms each row (which is an array of strings) into a hash, where the column headers become the keys and the corresponding values from the row become the values.
