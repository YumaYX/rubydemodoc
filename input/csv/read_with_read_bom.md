This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read a CSV file with the `encoding` option set to `"BOM|UTF-8"`. The `CSV.read` method is used to read the contents of the CSV file and convert it into an array of hashes, where each hash represents a row in the CSV file. The `headers: true` option ensures that the first row of the CSV file is treated as a header row and its values are used as keys for the corresponding columns in the array of hashes.
