This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading a CSV file, converting each row into a hash, and returning an array of these hashes. It reads the file "file.csv" from the "input/csv" directory, using BOM|UTF-8 encoding and treating the first row as headers.  Each subsequent row is converted into a hash where the header names become keys and the row values become the corresponding values. The result is an array of these key-value pairs.
