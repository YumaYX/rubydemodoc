This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading a CSV file with the `CSV` module and returning an array of hashes where each hash represents a row in the CSV file. The `encoding` option is used to specify the encoding of the file, and `headers` is set to true to indicate that the first line of the file contains headers.
