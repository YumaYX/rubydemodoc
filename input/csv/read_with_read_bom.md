This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading a CSV file named "file.csv" located in the "input/csv" directory and converting its contents into an array of hashes. Specifically, the `require 'csv'` line loads the CSV library, which provides functions for working with CSV files. The `CSV.read()` method reads the specified CSV file, utilizing the "BOM|UTF-8" encoding to properly handle potential Byte Order Mark (BOM) characters alongside UTF-8 character encoding, ensuring that the file is interpreted correctly. The `headers: true` argument tells the CSV reader to use the first row of the CSV file as column headers. Finally, `.map(&:to_h)` iterates over each row represented as an array and converts it into a hash using the `to_h` method, where each key in the hash corresponds to a column header from the CSV file, resulting in an array of hashes where each hash represents a row from the CSV.
