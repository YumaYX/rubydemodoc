This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading a CSV file (`file.csv`) with UTF-8 encoding (handling Byte Order Marks) and converting each row into a hash, using the headers as keys. The `map(&:to_h)` part transforms each row (which is initially an array) into a hash where the first element of the row becomes the key, and the second element becomes the value. The result is an array of hashes.
