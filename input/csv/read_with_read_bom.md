This code reads a CSV file named 'file.csv' using the `CSV` library in Ruby. 

*   `CSV.read('input/csv/file.csv', encoding: "BOM|UTF-8", headers: true)`: This line reads the CSV file, specifying the encoding as "BOM|UTF-8" (which handles Byte Order Mark for UTF-8) and indicates that the first row contains the column headers.
*   `.map(&:to_h)`: This part iterates through each row (after being read from the CSV) and converts it into a hash.  The `to_h` method transforms each row into a hash where the keys are the column headers and the values are the corresponding data from that row.
