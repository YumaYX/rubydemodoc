This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read a CSV file and process each row, printing the header and corresponding value for each row. Specifically, the code utilizes the `csv` gem to parse the CSV file named "file.csv" located in the "input/csv" directory. It opens the file in read mode ("r") and creates a `CSV` object from it, indicating that the file contains header rows. The code then iterates through each row of the CSV file, and within each row, it iterates through each header and its associated value. For every row, it prints a pair containing the header and the value, and then prints an empty line to separate the output for each row.  The use of `CSV.new(f, headers: true)` ensures the first row is treated as the header row and all subsequent rows are correctly processed.
