This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read a CSV file using the `CSV` library in Ruby. Specifically, it opens a CSV file named “input/csv/file.csv” in read mode (“r”). Then, it creates a `CSV` object named `csv` using the opened file and sets the `headers: true` option, which indicates that the first row of the CSV file contains the column headers. The code iterates through each line of the CSV file, and for each line, it iterates through the columns. For each column, it prints the column header and its corresponding value. Finally, it prints a newline character to separate the output from different lines.
