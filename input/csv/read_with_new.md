This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read a CSV file and process each row, printing the header and corresponding value for each row. The code first requires the `csv` library, which provides functionality for working with CSV files.  It then opens the file named "input/csv/file.csv" in read mode ("r") and creates a `CSV` object from it, specifying that the file has headers.  The code iterates through each row of the CSV file.  Within each row, it iterates through each header and its associated value.  For each header-value pair, it prints them to the console using the `p` method, which is a Ruby debugging tool that prints the object.  Finally, it prints a newline character (`puts`) after each row to create a more readable output, separating the rows visually.
