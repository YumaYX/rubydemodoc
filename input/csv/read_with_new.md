This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading a CSV file named "file.csv" located in the "input/csv" directory. It uses the `CSV` library to parse the file, iterating through each row, and printing each header and corresponding value to the console, followed by a newline. The code then displays an array containing "key" and "key1", followed by another newline. Finally, it prints an array containing "key" and "key2", followed by another newline. The last line is implicitly returned, which is `nil`.
