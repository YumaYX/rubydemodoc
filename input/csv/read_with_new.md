This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading a CSV file (`file.csv`) and printing each header-value pair from each row. It uses the `CSV` library to parse the file, assuming the first row contains headers. The code iterates through each row and then through each header-value pair in that row, printing them to the console, followed by a newline after each row's output.
