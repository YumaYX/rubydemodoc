This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read a CSV file with headers and iterate through each line, printing the header and corresponding value for each column.

The code first opens a CSV file named "file.csv" in read mode (`r`). It then creates a `CSV` object associated with the file, specifying that the first row of the CSV contains the headers (`headers: true`). The code iterates through each `line` in the CSV file using `csv.each`. Inside the loop, it iterates through each `header` and `val` pair in the current line. For each pair, it prints a new array containing the `header` and `val`. After processing each line, it prints a newline character to separate the output of different lines.  In essence, the code reads the CSV file, treats the first row as column names, and then prints each row as a pair of (header, value).
