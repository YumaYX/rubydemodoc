This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read a CSV file, process each line, and print the header and value for each column. The code first opens a CSV file named "file.csv" in read mode. It then creates a `CSV` object associated with the file, specifying that the first row contains headers. The code iterates through each line in the CSV file. For each line, it iterates through the header and value pairs in the line. Inside the inner loop, it prints an array containing the header and its corresponding value. After processing all lines, the code prints a newline character to separate the output of different CSV files.
