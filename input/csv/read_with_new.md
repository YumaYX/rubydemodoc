This Ruby code snippet demonstrates reading a CSV file, iterating through each line, and then iterating through each column (header-value pair) within that line. It prints each header-value pair to the console. The code then provides example data for the header and value pairs, simulating the output of the CSV reading process. Finally, it returns `nil`.
