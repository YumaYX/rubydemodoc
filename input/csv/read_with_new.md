This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read a CSV file and iterate over each row and column. The `CSV` class is used to parse the CSV file, and the `headers: true` option is set to indicate that the first line of the CSV file contains headers. The `csv.each` method is used to iterate over each row in the CSV file, and the `line.each` method is used to iterate over each column in a row. The `[header, val]` array is printed for each header and value in a cell. The `puts` statement is used to print a newline character after each row.
