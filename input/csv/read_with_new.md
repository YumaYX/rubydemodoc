This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to read a CSV file and print the contents of each line to the console using the `CSV` module in Ruby. The `CSV` module provides a simple way to read and write comma-separated values (CSV) files, including parsing and generating headers.

In this code, we first open a file for reading (`"input/csv/file.csv"`), and then create a new instance of the `CSV` class using the `CSV.new()` method. We pass in the file object as an argument, along with the option `headers: true`, which tells `CSV` to treat the first line of the file as headers.

Next, we loop through each line of the CSV file using the `csv.each()` method. Inside this block, we loop through each header and value pair in the current line using the `line.each()` method. We print each pair to the console using `p [header, val]`, where `header` is the name of the column and `val` is the value for that column.

Finally, we use `puts` to output a newline character after each line of the CSV file. This separates each row of data on the console.
