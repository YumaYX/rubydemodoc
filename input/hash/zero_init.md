This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of a hash with a default value for keys that haven't been explicitly set. Initially, a hash named `hash` is created using `Hash.new(0)`. This configuration means that whenever a key is accessed that doesnâ€™t yet exist in the hash, the default value of `0` is automatically returned. Then, the code attempts to increment the value associated with the key `'key'` within the hash. Since `'key'` was not initially present, the default value of `0` is returned and then incremented by `1`, effectively setting the value for `'key'` to `1`.
