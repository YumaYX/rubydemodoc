This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of a hash with a default value. The code initializes a hash named `hash` using the `Hash.new(0)` constructor. This creates a hash where, if a key is not found, the default value of `0` is returned. Subsequently, the code attempts to increment the value associated with the key `'key'` within the hash. Because `'key'` is a new key, it doesn't initially exist, so the default value of `0` is returned, and then incremented by 1, effectively setting the value associated with `'key'` to `1`.
