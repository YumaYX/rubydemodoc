This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of a default value initializer in a hash. Initially, a hash is created with a default value of 0 for any key.  The `+= 1` operation increments the value associated with the key 'key' to 1, effectively initializing the key's value to 1 if it doesn't already exist.
