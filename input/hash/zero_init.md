This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of `Hash.new(0)` to create a hash with a default value of 0.  When accessing a key that doesn't exist (like 'key' initially), it returns 0, allowing you to increment it directly without needing to check if the key exists first. This provides a concise way to count occurrences or accumulate values associated with hash keys.
