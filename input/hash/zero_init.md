This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the creation and modification of a hash in Ruby. First, a new hash is initialized using `Hash.new(0)`. This creates a hash where the default value for any missing key is 0. Then, the code accesses the key 'key' in the hash and increments its value by 1 using the `+=` operator. If the key 'key' did not exist initially, it is created with a default value of 0, and then incremented to 1. The final value associated with the key 'key' in the hash will be 1.
