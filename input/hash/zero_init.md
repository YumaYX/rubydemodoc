 This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to increment the value of a key in a hash by using the `+=` operator. The `Hash.new(0)` method creates a new hash with all values initialized to zero, so when we try to access a key that doesn't exist, it will return 0.
```
hash = Hash.new(0)
hash['key'] += 1
```
The first line creates a new hash called `hash` and initializes all its values to 0. The second line tries to access the value associated with the key `'key'`, but since that key doesn't exist, it returns 0. Then we use the `+=` operator to add 1 to that value, so now the new value for the key `'key'` is 1.
Note: It's important to remember that in Ruby, hashes are not ordered, so when you access a value by its key, the order of the keys and values may change.
