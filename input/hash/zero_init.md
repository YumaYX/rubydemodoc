This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the creation and modification of a hash in Ruby. First, a new hash is initialized using `Hash.new(0)`. This creates a hash where the default value for any missing key is 0. Then, the code attempts to increment the value associated with the key 'key' by 1 using `hash['key'] += 1`. If the key 'key' doesn't exist in the hash, it's automatically added with a default value of 0, and then incremented to 1. If the key 'key' already exists, its current value is incremented by 1. In essence, this code initializes a hash with a default value of 0 and then increments the value associated with the key 'key' by one, effectively setting the value of 'key' to 1.
