This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `digest/md5` library to calculate the MD5 hash of a string and the MD5 hash of a file.  The first line, `require 'digest/md5'`, imports the necessary library into the current Ruby environment.  Then, `Digest::MD5.hexdigest('ruby')` calculates the MD5 hash of the string "ruby" and returns it as a hexadecimal string, which is then printed to the console.  The second line, `Digest::MD5.file('input/digest/md5sum.rb').to_s`, calculates the MD5 hash of the file named 'input/digest/md5sum.rb'.  The `.to_s` method converts the resulting hash object into a string representation of its hexadecimal value, which is also then printed to the console, displaying the MD5 checksum of the specified file.
