This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `digest/md5` library to calculate the MD5 hash of a string and a file. First, it calculates the MD5 hash of the string "ruby" using `Digest::MD5.hexdigest()`, which returns the hexadecimal representation of the hash. Second, it calculates the MD5 hash of the file "input/digest/md5sum.rb" using `Digest::MD5.file()`, which returns the hexadecimal representation of the hash as a string. The `to_s` method is used to convert the hash object to a string. The MD5 hash is a 128-bit hash value, typically represented as a 32-character hexadecimal string.
