This Ruby code snippet demonstrates how to calculate the MD5 hash of a string and how to get the MD5 hash of a file.  The first line utilizes the `digest/md5` library to calculate the MD5 hash of the string "ruby", which is then returned as a hexadecimal string. The second line uses the `Digest::MD5.file` method to calculate the MD5 hash of the file named `input/digest/md5sum.rb`. The `.to_s` method converts the resulting hash object into a string representation, displaying the hexadecimal representation of the file's MD5 hash.
