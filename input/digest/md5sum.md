This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the use of the `Digest::MD5` class in Ruby for calculating the MD5 hash of a given string or file. The `Digest::MD5.hexdigest(ruby)` method calculates the MD5 hash of the string stored in the variable `ruby` and returns it as a hexadecimal string.  The `Digest::MD5.file('input/digest/md5sum.rb').to_s` method calculates the MD5 hash of the file located at the path 'input/digest/md5sum.rb' and returns the hash as a hexadecimal string.  Essentially, both lines of code compute the MD5 hash of data, with the second line specifically handling a file input. The returned hash is a 32-byte (256-bit) hexadecimal representation of the input data.
