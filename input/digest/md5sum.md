This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the usage of the `Digest` module in Ruby to calculate MD5 hashes. The first line requires the `digest/md5` library, which is part of the standard library in Ruby.

The second line uses the `hexdigest` method provided by the `Digest::MD5` class to calculate the MD5 hash of a string. In this case, the string `'ruby'` is passed as an argument to the method. The resulting MD5 hash is returned as a hexadecimal string.

The third line uses the `file` method provided by the `Digest::MD5` class to calculate the MD5 hash of a file. In this case, the file `'input/digest/md5sum.rb'` is passed as an argument to the method. The resulting MD5 hash is returned as a hexadecimal string.

Note that in order to use these methods, you need to have the `digest` library installed on your system. You can install it using the Ruby package manager, such as `gem install digest`.
