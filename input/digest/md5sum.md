This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the usage of the `Digest::MD5` class in Ruby for calculating and representing the hexadecimal hash values of strings and files. The `Digest::MD5.hexdigest("ruby")` line calculates the MD5 hash of the string "ruby" and returns the hexadecimal representation of the hash, which is '58e53d1324eef6265fdb97b08ed9aadf'.  Additionally, the `Digest::MD5.file('input/digest/md5sum.rb').to_s` line calculates the MD5 hash of the file named 'input/digest/md5sum.rb' and returns the hexadecimal representation of the hash.
