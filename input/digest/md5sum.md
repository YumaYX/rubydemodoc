This Ruby code snippet demonstrates the usage of the `Digest::MD5` library for generating MD5 hash values. It first checks if the library is available. Then, it calculates the MD5 hash of the string "ruby" and prints the hexadecimal representation.  Finally, it calculates the MD5 hash of the file "input/digest/md5sum.rb" and prints the hexadecimal representation of the hash.  MD5 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit hash value.
